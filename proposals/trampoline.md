## Introduction

As the network grows, more bandwidth and storage will be required to keep an
up-to-date view of the whole network. Finding a payment path will also require
more computing power, making it unsustainable for constrained devices.

Constrained devices should only keep a view of a small part of the network and
leverage trampoline nodes to route payments.

While a thorough analysis has not been made, the current state of the proposal
should not result in a loss of privacy; on the contrary, it gives more routing
flexibility and is likely to improve the anonymity set.

## Overview

Nodes that are able to calculate (partial) routes on behalf of other nodes will
advertise support for the `trampoline_routing` feature. This is an opportunity
for them to earn more fees than with the default onion routing (payers choose
to pay a fee premium in exchange for reliable path-finding-as-a-service from
trampoline nodes).

A payer selects a few trampoline nodes and builds a corresponding trampoline
onion, very similar to the normal onion; the only difference is that the next
nodes are identified by `node_id` instead of `short_channel_id` and may not be
direct peers.

The payer then embeds that trampoline onion in the last `hop_payload` of an
`onion_packet` destined to the first trampoline node. Computing routes between
trampoline nodes is then deferred to the trampoline nodes themselves.

A trampoline payment will thus look like this:

```text
Trampoline route:

Alice ---> Bob ---> Carol ---> Dave

Complete route:

        +--> Irvin --> Iris --+          +--> ... --+            +--> ... --+
        |                     |          |          |            |          |
        |                     |          |          |            |          |
Alice --+                     +--> Bob --+          +--> Carol --+          +--> Dave

<----------------------------------><----------------------><--------------------->
            (normal payment)            (normal payment)        (normal payment)
```

Note that this construction still uses onions created by the payer so it doesn't
sacrifice privacy (in most cases it may even provide a bigger anonymity set).

## Trampoline onion

A trampoline onion uses the same construction as normal payment onions but with
a smaller size, to allow embedding it inside a normal payment onion.

For example, Alice may want to pay Carol using trampoline. Alice inserts
trampoline nodes between her and Carol. For this example we use a single
trampoline (Bob) but Alice may use more than one trampoline.

Alice then finds a route to the first trampoline Bob. The complete route is:

```text
        +--> Irvin --> Iris --+          +--> ... --+
        |                     |          |          |
        |                     |          |          |
Alice --+                     +--> Bob --+          +--> Carol
```

Note again that Alice only needs to find a route to Bob (instead of having to
find a complete route to Carol). She doesn't know what route will be used
between Bob and Carol: it will be Bob's responsibility to find one that works.

If Alice wants to send 50 000 msat to Carol, the corresponding `update_add_htlc`
message sent by Alice to Irvin will look like:

```

When Bob receives the trampoline onion, he discovers that the next node is Carol.
Bob finds a route to Carol, builds a new payment onion and includes the peeled
trampoline onion in the final payload. This process may repeat with multiple
trampoline hops until we reach the final recipient.

Here is an example flow of `update_add_htlc` messages received at each hop:

```text
Alice ------------------> Irvin -------------------------------------> Iris -----------------------------------> Bob -----------------------------------------> John ------------------------------------> Jack ------------------------------------> Carol

                      update_add_htlc                            update_add_htlc                            update_add_htlc                                update_add_htlc                            update_add_htlc                            update_add_htlc

## Returning errors

Trampoline nodes apply the same error-wrapping mechanism used for normal onions
at the trampoline onion level. This results in two layers of error wrapping
that let the origin node get actionable data for potential retries.

### Notations

We note `ss(Alice, Bob)` the shared secret between Alice and Bob for the outer
onion encryption, and `tss(Alice, Bob)` the shared secret between Alice and Bob
for the trampoline onion encryption.

### Error before the first trampoline

* T2 discovers E2 is the failing node by unwrapping with outer onion shared

  to return to the payer, and wraps it with the trampoline shared secret and
  then the outer onion shared secret: `wrap(ss(T1,T2), wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error))`
* T1 receives `wrap(ss(T1, M1), wrap(ss(T1,T2), wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error)))`
* After unwrapping with the outer onion shared secrets T1 obtains: `wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error)`

  forwards upstream `wrap(ss(Alice,T1), wrap(tss(Alice,T1), wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error)))`
* Alice receives `wrap(ss(Alice,N1), wrap(ss(Alice,N2), wrap(ss(Alice,T1), wrap(tss(Alice,T1), wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error)))))`
* She unwraps with the outer onion secrets and obtains: `wrap(tss(Alice,T1), wrap(tss(Alice,T2), error))`
* Since this is still not a plaintext error, she unwraps with the trampoline
  onion secrets, recovers `error` and knows that T2 sent it.

### Unparsable error somewhere in the route

This works the same, each trampoline unwraps as much as it can then re-wraps.
It will result in an unparsable error at Alice (as expected).

## Invoice flow

Now the question is: how does Alice choose the trampoline nodes to reach Carol?

Similarly to what is done for normal payments, we introduce trampoline hints in
Bolt 11 invoices. Carol can run a simple breadth-first search to select a few
trampoline nodes that will be able to relay payments to her and calculates the
fees and cltv for the corresponding routes. If Carol is accessible via public
channels, she may not even need to include any trampoline hint.

Each trampoline hint contains only the `node_id` of the trampoline node, a
`cltv_expiry_delta`, `fee_base_msat` and `fee_proportional_millionths`, for
example:

```json
{
  "trampoline_hints": [
    {
      "node_id": "036d6caac248af96f6afa7f904f550253a0f3ef3f5aa2fe6838a95b216691468e2",
      "cltv_expiry_delta": 288,
      "fee_base_msat": 5,
      "fee_proportional_millionths": 300
    },
    {
      "node_id": "025f7117a78150fe2ef97db7cfc83bd57b2e2c0d0dd25eaf467a4a1c2a45ce1486",
      "cltv_expiry_delta": 432,
      "fee_base_msat": 8,
      "fee_proportional_millionths": 250
    }
  ]
}
```

When Alice wants to pay the invoice, she selects a trampoline node close to her
(let's call it T1) and a trampoline node from Carol's invoice (let's call it
T2). If Carol doesn't include any routing hint in the invoice, T2 = Carol.

Alice then simply uses the trampoline route `Alice -> T1 -> T2 -> Carol` and
creates the corresponding trampoline onion. Alice then finds a route to T1, and
sends the payment through that route.

|    Alice -----> N1 -----> T1     |-------> (public network graph) ------->|    T2 -----> N7 -----> Carol   |
|      |                           |                                        |                                |
|      |                           |                                        +--------------------------------+
|      +-----> N2 -----> T5        |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+
```

Alice and Carol both assume connectivity between their respective neighborhoods.
Note that this assumption is also necessary with the default source-routing
scheme, so trampoline is not adding any new restrictions.

Alice is completely free to add more intermediate trampoline hops to the route
to improve privacy (by effectively using longer routes) or to ensure a given
node is able to witness the payment.

## Privacy

Trampoline routing allows constrained devices to send and receive payments
without sacrificing privacy.

Such nodes are advised to sync only a small portion of the graph (their local
neighborhood) and to ensure connectivity to a few distinct trampoline nodes.

This allows them to insert normal hops before the first trampoline node, thus
protecting their privacy with the same guarantees as normal payments. In the
example graph from the previous section, T1 cannot know that the payment comes
from Alice because it only sees an HTLC coming from N1 (especially if Alice is
using an unannounced channel to N1). When T1 receives the HTLC, it cannot know
if the next node in the route (T2) is the final destination or not. Similarly,
T2 cannot know that Carol is the recipient nor that the payment comes from
Alice (T2 cannot even know that the previous trampoline node was T1).

On top of these guarantees, receivers may use route-blinding or rendezvous to
hide their exact location. Rendezvous is hard to use with fully source-routed
payments because if a single channel disappears (or simply does not have enough
liquidity to relay the payment), it invalidates the whole rendezvous onion.
Trampoline rendezvous does not have this issue because trampoline routes are
by design more flexible (only the `node_ids` are fixed, but any route between
these `node_ids` can be used as long as they fit the fee budget allocated to
each trampoline hop).

## Trampoline MPP

Trampoline routing combines nicely with multi-part payments. When multi-part
payment is used, we can let trampoline nodes combine all the incoming partial
payments before forwarding. Once the totality of the payment is received, the
trampoline node can choose the most efficient way to re-split it to reach the
next trampoline node.

For example, Alice could split a payment in 3 parts to reach a trampoline node,
which would then split it in only 2 parts to reach the destination (we use a
single hop between trampoline nodes for simplicity here, but any number of
intermediate nodes may be used):

## Future gossip extensions

With the current gossip mechanisms, some bandwidth will be unnecessarily wasted
when constrained nodes sync their local neighborhood, because they have no way
of asking for `channel_update`s within a given distance boundary nor telling
their peers to *not* relay some updates to them.

That can be easily addressed in the future with new Bolt 7 gossip queries, but
is not mandatory to the deployment of trampoline routing.

Two mechanisms in particular would be useful:

* `channel_update` filters: constrained nodes can ask their peers to discard
  updates coming from nodes that are further than N hops instead of relaying
  them.
* distance-based gossip queries: constrained nodes can ask their peers for all
  updates from nodes that are at most N hops far, and combine that with the
  current gossip query tricks to avoid replaying updates they already have.
