# Transactions

## Transaction Output Ordering

Outputs in transactions are always sorted according to:
 * first according to their value, smallest first (in whole satoshis, note that for HTLC outputs, the millisatoshi part must be ignored)
 * followed by `scriptpubkey`, comparing the common-length prefix lexicographically as if by `memcmp`, then selecting the shorter script (if they differ in length),
 * finally, for HTLC outputs, in increasing `cltv_expiry` order.

## Rationale

Two offered HTLCs which have the same `amount` (rounded from `amount_msat`) and
`payment_hash` will have identical outputs, even if their `cltv_expiry`
differs.  This only matters because the same ordering is used to send
`htlc_signatures` and the HTLC transactions themselves are different, thus the
two peers must agree on the canonical ordering for this case.

## Use of Segwit

Most transaction outputs used here are pay-to-witness-script-hash<sup>[BIP141](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki#witness-program)</sup> (P2WSH) outputs: the Segwit version of P2SH. To spend such outputs, the last item on the witness stack must be the actual script that was used to generate the P2WSH output that is being spent. This last item has been omitted for brevity in the rest of this document.

A `<>` designates an empty vector as required for compliance with MINIMALIF-standard rule.<sup>[MINIMALIF](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-August/013014.html)</sup>

## Funding Transaction Output

* The funding output script is a P2WSH to:

`2 <pubkey1> <pubkey2> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG`

* Where `pubkey1` is the lexicographically lesser of the two `funding_pubkey` in compressed format, and where `pubkey2` is the lexicographically greater of the two.

## Commitment Transaction

* version: 2
* locktime: upper 8 bits are 0x20, lower 24 bits are the lower 24 bits of the obscured commitment number
* txin count: 1
   * `txin[0]` outpoint: `txid` and `output_index` from `funding_created` message
   * `txin[0]` sequence: upper 8 bits are 0x80, lower 24 bits are upper 24 bits of the obscured commitment number
   * `txin[0]` script bytes: 0
   * `txin[0]` witness: `0 <signature_for_pubkey1> <signature_for_pubkey2>`

The 48-bit commitment number is obscured by `XOR` with the lower 48 bits of:

    SHA256(payment_basepoint from open_channel || payment_basepoint from accept_channel)

This obscures the number of commitments made on the channel in the
case of unilateral close, yet still provides a useful index for both
nodes (who know the `payment_basepoint`s) to quickly find a revoked
commitment transaction.

### Commitment Transaction Outputs

To allow an opportunity for penalty transactions, in case of a revoked commitment transaction, all outputs that return funds to the owner of the commitment transaction (a.k.a. the "local node") must be delayed for `to_self_delay` blocks. For HTLCs this delay is done in a second-stage HTLC transaction (HTLC-success for HTLCs accepted by the local node, HTLC-timeout for HTLCs offered by the local node).

The reason for the separate transaction stage for HTLC outputs is so that HTLCs can timeout or be fulfilled even though they are within the `to_self_delay` delay.
Otherwise, the required minimum timeout on HTLCs is lengthened by this delay, causing longer timeouts for HTLCs traversing the network.

The amounts for each output MUST be rounded down to whole satoshis. If this amount, minus the fees for the HTLC transaction, is less than the `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the owner of the commitment transaction, the output MUST NOT be produced (thus the funds add to fees).

#### `to_local` Output

This output sends funds back to the owner of this commitment transaction and thus must be timelocked using `OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY`. It can be claimed, without delay, by the other party if they know the revocation private key. The output is a version-0 P2WSH, with a witness script:

    OP_IF
        # Penalty transaction
        <revocationpubkey>
    OP_ELSE
        `to_self_delay`
        OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
        OP_DROP
        <local_delayedpubkey>
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_CHECKSIG

The output is spent by an input with `nSequence` field set to `to_self_delay` (which can only be valid after that duration has passed) and witness:

    <local_delayedsig> <>

If a revoked commitment transaction is published, the other party can spend this output immediately with the following witness:

    <revocation_sig> 1

#### `to_remote` Output

If `option_anchors` applies to the commitment transaction, the `to_remote` output is encumbered by a one block csv lock.

    <remotepubkey> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY 1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY

The output is spent by an input with `nSequence` field set to `1` and witness:

    <remote_sig>

Otherwise, this output is a simple P2WPKH to `remotepubkey`. Note: the remote's commitment transaction uses your `localpubkey` for their
`to_remote` output to yourself.

#### `to_local_anchor` and `to_remote_anchor` Output (option_anchors)

This output can be spent by the local and remote nodes respectively to provide incentive to mine the transaction, using child-pays-for-parent. Both
anchor outputs are always added, except for the case where there are no htlcs and one of the parties has a commitment output that is below the dust limit. 
In that case only an anchor is added for the commitment output that does materialize. This typically happens if the initiator closes right after opening
(no `to_remote` output).

    <local_funding_pubkey/remote_funding_pubkey> OP_CHECKSIG OP_IFDUP
    OP_NOTIF
        OP_16 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
    OP_ENDIF

Each party has its own anchor output that locks to their funding key. This is to prevent a malicious peer from attaching child transactions with a low fee
density to an anchor and thereby blocking the victim from getting the commit tx confirmed in time. This defense is supported by a change in Bitcoin core 0.19:
https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/15681. This is also the reason that every non-anchor output on the commit tx is CSV locked.

To prevent utxo set pollution, any anchor that remains unspent can be spent by anyone after the commitment tx confirms. This is also the reason to lock
the anchor outputs to the funding key. Third parties can observe this key and reconstruct the spend script, even if none of the commitment outputs would
be spent. This does assume that at some point the fee market goes down to a level where sweeping the anchors is economical.

The amount of the output is fixed at 330 sats, the default dust limit for P2WSH.

Spending of the output requires the following witness:

    <local_sig/remote_sig>

After 16 blocks, anyone can sweep the anchor with witness:

    <>

#### Offered HTLC Outputs

This output sends funds to either an HTLC-timeout transaction after the HTLC-timeout or to the remote node using the payment preimage or the revocation key. The output is a P2WSH, with a witness script (no option_anchors):

    # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_htlcpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_NOTIF
            # To local node via HTLC-timeout transaction (timelocked).
            OP_DROP 2 OP_SWAP <local_htlcpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node with preimage.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
    OP_ENDIF

Or, with `option_anchors`:

    # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_htlcpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_NOTIF
            # To local node via HTLC-timeout transaction (timelocked).
            OP_DROP 2 OP_SWAP <local_htlcpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node with preimage.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
        1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
    OP_ENDIF

The remote node can redeem the HTLC with the witness:

    <remotehtlcsig> <payment_preimage>

Note that if `option_anchors` applies, the nSequence field of
the spending input must be `1`.

If a revoked commitment transaction is published, the remote node can spend this output immediately with the following witness:

    <revocation_sig> <revocationpubkey>

The sending node can use the HTLC-timeout transaction to timeout the HTLC once the HTLC is expired, as shown below. This is the only way that the local node can timeout the HTLC, and this branch requires `<remotehtlcsig>`, which ensures that the local node cannot prematurely timeout the HTLC since the HTLC-timeout transaction has `cltv_expiry` as its specified `locktime`. The local node must also wait `to_self_delay` before accessing these funds, allowing for the remote node to claim these funds if the transaction has been revoked.

#### Received HTLC Outputs

This output sends funds to either the remote node after the HTLC-timeout or using the revocation key, or to an HTLC-success transaction with a successful payment preimage. The output is a P2WSH, with a witness script (no `option_anchors`):

    # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_htlcpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_IF
            # To local node via HTLC-success transaction.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            2 OP_SWAP <local_htlcpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node after timeout.
            OP_DROP <cltv_expiry> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
    OP_ENDIF

Or, with `option_anchors`:

    # To remote node with revocation key
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(SHA256(revocationpubkey))> OP_EQUAL
    OP_IF
        OP_CHECKSIG
    OP_ELSE
        <remote_htlcpubkey> OP_SWAP OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUAL
        OP_IF
            # To local node via HTLC-success transaction.
            OP_HASH160 <RIPEMD160(payment_hash)> OP_EQUALVERIFY
            2 OP_SWAP <local_htlcpubkey> 2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
        OP_ELSE
            # To remote node after timeout.
            OP_DROP <cltv_expiry> OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY OP_DROP
            OP_CHECKSIG
        OP_ENDIF
        1 OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP
    OP_ENDIF

To timeout the HTLC, the remote node spends it with the witness:

    <remotehtlcsig> <>

Note that if `option_anchors` applies, the nSequence field of
the spending input must be `1`.

If a revoked commitment transaction is published, the remote node can spend this output immediately with the following witness:

    <revocation_sig> <revocationpubkey>

To redeem the HTLC, the HTLC-success transaction is used as detailed below. This is the only way that the local node can spend the HTLC, since this branch requires `<remotehtlcsig>`, which ensures that the local node must wait `to_self_delay` before accessing these funds allowing for the remote node to claim these funds if the transaction has been revoked.

### Trimmed Outputs

Each peer specifies a `dust_limit_satoshis` below which outputs should
not be produced; these outputs that are not produced are termed "trimmed". A trimmed output is
considered too small to be worth creating and is instead added
to the commitment transaction fee. For HTLCs, it needs to be taken into
account that the second-stage HTLC transaction may also be below the
limit.

#### Requirements

The base fee and anchor output values:
  - before the commitment transaction outputs are determined:
    - MUST be subtracted from the `to_local` or `to_remote`
    outputs, as specified in [Fee Calculation](#fee-calculation).

The commitment transaction:
  - if the amount of the commitment transaction `to_local` output would be
less than `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the transaction owner:
    - MUST NOT contain that output.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST be generated as specified in [`to_local` Output](#to_local-output).
  - if the amount of the commitment transaction `to_remote` output would be
less than `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the transaction owner:
    - MUST NOT contain that output.
  - otherwise:
    - MUST be generated as specified in [`to_remote` Output](#to_remote-output).
  - for every offered HTLC:
    - if the HTLC amount minus the HTLC-timeout fee would be less than
    `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the transaction owner:
      - MUST NOT contain that output.
    - otherwise:
      - MUST be generated as specified in
      [Offered HTLC Outputs](#offered-htlc-outputs).
  - for every received HTLC:
    - if the HTLC amount minus the HTLC-success fee would be less than
    `dust_limit_satoshis` set by the transaction owner:
      - MUST NOT contain that output.
    - otherwise:
      - MUST be generated as specified in
      [Received HTLC Outputs](#received-htlc-outputs).

## HTLC-Timeout and HTLC-Success Transactions

These HTLC transactions are almost identical, except the HTLC-timeout transaction is timelocked. Both HTLC-timeout/HTLC-success transactions can be spent by a valid penalty transaction.

* version: 2
* locktime: `0` for HTLC-success, `cltv_expiry` for HTLC-timeout
* txin count: 1
   * `txin[0]` outpoint: `txid` of the commitment transaction and `output_index` of the matching HTLC output for the HTLC transaction
   * `txin[0]` sequence: `0` (set to `1` for `option_anchors`)
   * `txin[0]` script bytes: `0`
   * `txin[0]` witness stack: `0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig>  <payment_preimage>` for HTLC-success, `0 <remotehtlcsig> <localhtlcsig> <>` for HTLC-timeout
* txout count: 1
   * `txout[0]` amount: the HTLC `amount_msat` divided by 1000 (rounding down) minus fees in satoshis (see [Fee Calculation](#fee-calculation))
   * `txout[0]` script: version-0 P2WSH with witness script as shown below
* if `option_anchors` applies to this commitment transaction, `SIGHASH_SINGLE|SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY` is used as described in [BOLT #5](05-onchain.md#generation-of-htlc-transactions).

The witness script for the output is:

    OP_IF
        # Penalty transaction
        <revocationpubkey>
    OP_ELSE
        `to_self_delay`
        OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY
        OP_DROP
        <local_delayedpubkey>
    OP_ENDIF
    OP_CHECKSIG

To spend this via penalty, the remote node uses a witness stack `<revocationsig> 1`, and to collect the output, the local node uses an input with nSequence `to_self_delay` and a witness stack `<local_delayedsig> 0`.

## Closing Transaction

Note that there are two possible variants for each node.

* version: 2
* locktime: 0
* txin count: 1
   * `txin[0]` outpoint: `txid` and `output_index` from `funding_created` message
   * `txin[0]` sequence: 0xFFFFFFFF
   * `txin[0]` script bytes: 0
   * `txin[0]` witness: `0 <signature_for_pubkey1> <signature_for_pubkey2>`
* txout count: 0, 1 or 2
   * `txout` amount: final balance to be paid to one node (minus `fee_satoshis` from `closing_signed`, if this peer funded the channel)
   * `txout` script: as specified in that node's `scriptpubkey` in its `shutdown` message

### Requirements

Each node offering a signature:
  - MUST round each output down to whole satoshis.
  - MUST subtract the fee given by `fee_satoshis` from the output to the funder.
  - MUST remove any output below its own `dust_limit_satoshis`.
  - MAY eliminate its own output.

### Rationale

There is a possibility of irreparable differences on closing if one
node considers the other's output too small to allow propagation on
the Bitcoin network (a.k.a. "dust"), and that other node instead
considers that output too valuable to discard. This is why each
side uses its own `dust_limit_satoshis`, and the result can be a
signature validation failure, if they disagree on what the closing
transaction should look like.

However, if one side chooses to eliminate its own output, there's no
reason for the other side to fail the closing protocol; so this is
explicitly allowed. The signature indicates which variant
has been used.

There will be at least one output, if the funding amount is greater
than twice `dust_limit_satoshis`.

## Fees

### Fee Calculation

The fee calculation for both commitment transactions and HTLC
transactions is based on the current `feerate_per_kw` and the
*expected weight* of the transaction.

The actual and expected weights vary for several reasons:

* Bitcoin uses DER-encoded signatures, which vary in size.
* Bitcoin also uses variable-length integers, so a large number of outputs will take 3 bytes to encode rather than 1.
* The `to_remote` output may be below the dust limit.
* The `to_local` output may be below the dust limit once fees are extracted.

Thus, a simplified formula for *expected weight* is used, which assumes:

* Signatures are 73 bytes long (the maximum length).
* There are a small number of outputs (thus 1 byte to count them).
* There are always both a `to_local` output and a `to_remote` output.
* (if `option_anchors`) there are always both a `to_local_anchor` and `to_remote_anchor` output.

This yields the following *expected weights* (details of the computation in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-expected-weights)):

    Commitment weight (no option_anchors):   724 + 172 * num-untrimmed-htlc-outputs
    Commitment weight (option_anchors):     1124 + 172 * num-untrimmed-htlc-outputs
    HTLC-timeout weight (no option_anchors): 663
    HTLC-timeout weight (option_anchors): 666
    HTLC-success weight (no option_anchors): 703
    HTLC-success weight (option_anchors): 706

Note the reference to the "base fee" for a commitment transaction in the requirements below, which is what the funder pays. The actual fee may be higher than the amount calculated here, due to rounding and trimmed outputs.

#### Requirements

The fee for an HTLC-timeout transaction:
  - If `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx` applies:
    1. MUST be 0.
  - Otherwise, MUST be calculated to match:
    1. Multiply `feerate_per_kw` by 663 (666 if `option_anchor_outputs` applies) and divide by 1000 (rounding down).

The fee for an HTLC-success transaction:
  - If `option_anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx` applies:
    1. MUST be 0.
  - Otherwise, MUST be calculated to match:
    1. Multiply `feerate_per_kw` by 703 (706 if `option_anchor_outputs` applies) and divide by 1000 (rounding down).

The base fee for a commitment transaction:
  - MUST be calculated to match:
    1. Start with `weight` = 724 (1124 if `option_anchors` applies).
    2. For each committed HTLC, if that output is not trimmed as specified in
    [Trimmed Outputs](#trimmed-outputs), add 172 to `weight`.
    3. Multiply `feerate_per_kw` by `weight`, divide by 1000 (rounding down).

#### Example

For example, suppose there is a `feerate_per_kw` of 5000, a `dust_limit_satoshis` of 546 satoshis, and a commitment transaction with:
* two offered HTLCs of 5000000 and 1000000 millisatoshis (5000 and 1000 satoshis)
* two received HTLCs of 7000000 and 800000 millisatoshis (7000 and 800 satoshis)

The HTLC-timeout transaction `weight` is 663, and thus the fee is 3315 satoshis.
The HTLC-success transaction `weight` is 703, and thus the fee is 3515 satoshis

The commitment transaction `weight` is calculated as follows:

* `weight` starts at 724.

* The offered HTLC of 5000 satoshis is above 546 + 3315 and results in:
  * an output of 5000 satoshi in the commitment transaction
  * an HTLC-timeout transaction of 5000 - 3315 satoshis that spends this output
  * `weight` increases to 896

* The offered HTLC of 1000 satoshis is below 546 + 3315 so it is trimmed.

* The received HTLC of 7000 satoshis is above 546 + 3515 and results in:
  * an output of 7000 satoshi in the commitment transaction
  * an HTLC-success transaction of 7000 - 3515 satoshis that spends this output
  * `weight` increases to 1068

* The received HTLC of 800 satoshis is below 546 + 3515 so it is trimmed.

The base commitment transaction fee is 5340 satoshi; the actual
fee (which adds the 1000 and 800 satoshi HTLCs that would make dust
outputs) is 7140 satoshi. The final fee may be even higher if the
`to_local` or `to_remote` outputs fall below `dust_limit_satoshis`.

### Fee Payment

Base commitment transaction fees and amounts for `to_local_anchor` and `to_remote_anchor` outputs are extracted from the funder's amount;
Restrictions to the commitment tx output for the funder in relation to the
channel reserve apply as described in [BOLT #2](02-peer-protocol.md).

Note that after the fee amount is subtracted from the to-funder output,
that output may be below `dust_limit_satoshis`, and thus will also
contribute to fees.

A node:
  - if the resulting fee rate is too low:
    - MAY send a `warning` and close the connection, or send an
      `error` and fail the channel.

## Dust Limits

The `dust_limit_satoshis` parameter is used to configure the threshold below
which nodes will not produce on-chain transaction outputs.

There is no consensus rule in Bitcoin that makes outputs below dust thresholds
invalid or unspendable, but policy rules in popular implementations will prevent
relaying transactions that contain such outputs.

Bitcoin Core defines the following dust thresholds:

- pay to pubkey hash (p2pkh): 546 satoshis
- pay to script hash (p2sh): 540 satoshis
- pay to witness pubkey hash (p2wpkh): 294 satoshis
- pay to witness script hash (p2wsh): 330 satoshis
- unknown segwit versions: 354 satoshis

The rationale of this calculation (implemented [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.21/src/policy/policy.cpp))
is explained in the following sections.

In all these sections, the calculations are done with a feerate of 3000 sat/kB
as per Bitcoin Core's implementation.

### Pay to pubkey hash (p2pkh)

A p2pkh output is 34 bytes:

- 8 bytes for the output amount
- 1 byte for the script length
- 25 bytes for the script (`OP_DUP` `OP_HASH160` `20` 20-bytes `OP_EQUALVERIFY` `OP_CHECKSIG`)

A p2pkh input is at least 148 bytes:

- 36 bytes for the previous output (32 bytes hash + 4 bytes index)
- 4 bytes for the sequence
- 1 byte for the script sig length
- 107 bytes for the script sig:
  - 1 byte for the items count
  - 1 byte for the signature length
  - 71 bytes for the signature
  - 1 byte for the public key length
  - 33 bytes for the public key

The p2pkh dust threshold is then `(34 + 148) * 3000 / 1000 = 546 satoshis`

### Pay to script hash (p2sh)

A p2sh output is 32 bytes:

- 8 bytes for the output amount
- 1 byte for the script length
- 23 bytes for the script (`OP_HASH160` `20` 20-bytes `OP_EQUAL`)

A p2sh input doesn't have a fixed size, since it depends on the underlying
script, so we use 148 bytes as a lower bound.

The p2sh dust threshold is then `(32 + 148) * 3000 / 1000 = 540 satoshis`

### Pay to witness pubkey hash (p2wpkh)

A p2wpkh output is 31 bytes:

- 8 bytes for the output amount
- 1 byte for the script length
- 22 bytes for the script (`OP_0` `20` 20-bytes)

A p2wpkh input is at least 67 bytes (depending on the signature length):

- 36 bytes for the previous output (32 bytes hash + 4 bytes index)
- 4 bytes for the sequence
- 1 byte for the script sig length
- 26 bytes for the witness (rounded down from 26.75, with the 75% segwit discount applied):
  - 1 byte for the items count
  - 1 byte for the signature length
  - 71 bytes for the signature
  - 1 byte for the public key length
  - 33 bytes for the public key

The p2wpkh dust threshold is then `(31 + 67) * 3000 / 1000 = 294 satoshis`

### Pay to witness script hash (p2wsh)

A p2wsh output is 43 bytes:

- 8 bytes for the output amount
- 1 byte for the script length
- 34 bytes for the script (`OP_0` `32` 32-bytes)

A p2wsh input doesn't have a fixed size, since it depends on the underlying
script, so we use 67 bytes as a lower bound.

The p2wsh dust threshold is then `(43 + 67) * 3000 / 1000 = 330 satoshis`

### Unknown segwit versions

Unknown segwit outputs are at most 51 bytes:

- 8 bytes for the output amount
- 1 byte for the script length
- 42 bytes for the script (`OP_1` through `OP_16` inclusive, followed by a single push of 2 to 40 bytes)

The input doesn't have a fixed size, since it depends on the underlying
script, so we use 67 bytes as a lower bound.

The unknown segwit version dust threshold is then `(51 + 67) * 3000 / 1000 = 354 satoshis`

## Commitment Transaction Construction

This section ties the previous sections together to detail the
algorithm for constructing the commitment transaction for one peer:
given that peer's `dust_limit_satoshis`, the current `feerate_per_kw`,
the amounts due to each peer (`to_local` and `to_remote`), and all
committed HTLCs:

1. Initialize the commitment transaction input and locktime, as specified
   in [Commitment Transaction](#commitment-transaction).
1. Calculate which committed HTLCs need to be trimmed (see [Trimmed Outputs](#trimmed-outputs)).
2. Calculate the base [commitment transaction fee](#fee-calculation).
3. Subtract this base fee from the funder (either `to_local` or `to_remote`).
If `option_anchors` applies to the commitment transaction,
also subtract two times the fixed anchor size of 330 sats from the funder
(either `to_local` or `to_remote`).
4. For every offered HTLC, if it is not trimmed, add an
   [offered HTLC output](#offered-htlc-outputs).
5. For every received HTLC, if it is not trimmed, add an
   [received HTLC output](#received-htlc-outputs).
6. If the `to_local` amount is greater or equal to `dust_limit_satoshis`,
   add a [`to_local` output](#to_local-output).
7. If the `to_remote` amount is greater or equal to `dust_limit_satoshis`,
   add a [`to_remote` output](#to_remote-output).
8. If `option_anchors` applies to the commitment transaction:
   * if `to_local` exists or there are untrimmed HTLCs, add a [`to_local_anchor` output](#to_local_anchor-and-to_remote_anchor-output-option_anchor_outputs)
   * if `to_remote` exists or there are untrimmed HTLCs, add a [`to_remote_anchor` output](#to_local_anchor-and-to_remote_anchor-output-option_anchor_outputs)
9. Sort the outputs into [BIP 69+CLTV order](#transaction-output-ordering).

# Keys

## Key Derivation

Each commitment transaction uses a unique `localpubkey`, and a `remotepubkey`.
The HTLC-success and HTLC-timeout transactions use `local_delayedpubkey` and `revocationpubkey`.
These are changed for every transaction based on the `per_commitment_point`.
For `option_static_remotekey` and `option_anchors`, no key rotation
is applied to `remotepubkey`.

The reason for key change is so that trustless watching for revoked
transactions can be outsourced. Such a _watcher_ should not be able to
determine the contents of a commitment transaction — even if the _watcher_ knows
which transaction ID to watch for and can make a reasonable guess
as to which HTLCs and balances may be included. Nonetheless, to
avoid storage of every commitment transaction, a _watcher_ can be given the
`per_commitment_secret` values (which can be stored compactly) and the
`revocation_basepoint` and `delayed_payment_basepoint` used to regenerate
the scripts required for the penalty transaction; thus, a _watcher_ need only be
given (and store) the signatures for each penalty input.

Changing the `localpubkey` every time ensures that commitment
transaction ID cannot be guessed except in the trivial case where there is no
`to_local` output, as every commitment transaction uses an ID
in its output script. Splitting the `local_delayedpubkey`, which is required for
the penalty transaction, allows it to be shared with the _watcher_ without
revealing `localpubkey`; even if both peers use the same _watcher_, nothing is revealed.

Finally, even in the case of normal unilateral close, the HTLC-success
and/or HTLC-timeout transactions do not reveal anything to the
_watcher_, as it does not know the corresponding `per_commitment_secret` and
cannot relate the `local_delayedpubkey` or `revocationpubkey` with their bases.

For efficiency, keys are generated from a series of per-commitment secrets
that are generated from a single seed, which allows the receiver to compactly
store them (see [below](#efficient-per-commitment-secret-storage)).

### `localpubkey`, `local_htlcpubkey`, `remote_htlcpubkey`, `local_delayedpubkey`, and `remote_delayedpubkey` Derivation

These pubkeys are simply generated by addition from their base points:

	pubkey = basepoint + SHA256(per_commitment_point || basepoint) * G

The `localpubkey` uses the local node's `payment_basepoint`;
The `remotepubkey` uses the remote node's `payment_basepoint`;
the `local_htlcpubkey` uses the local node's `htlc_basepoint`;
the `remote_htlcpubkey` uses the remote node's `htlc_basepoint`;
the `local_delayedpubkey` uses the local node's `delayed_payment_basepoint`;
and the `remote_delayedpubkey` uses the remote node's `delayed_payment_basepoint`.

The corresponding private keys can be similarly derived, if the basepoint
secrets are known (i.e. the private keys corresponding to `localpubkey`, `local_htlcpubkey`, and `local_delayedpubkey` only):

    privkey = basepoint_secret + SHA256(per_commitment_point || basepoint)

### `remotepubkey` Derivation

If `option_static_remotekey` or `option_anchors` is negotiated, the `remotepubkey` is simply the
remote node's `payment_basepoint`, otherwise it is calculated as above using
the remote node's `payment_basepoint`.

The simplified derivation means that a node can spend a commitment
transaction even if it has lost data and doesn't know the
corresponding `per_commitment_point`.  A watchtower could correlate
transactions given to it which only have a `to_remote` output if it
sees one of them onchain, but such transactions do not need any
enforcement and should not be handed to a watchtower.

### `revocationpubkey` Derivation

The `revocationpubkey` is a blinded key: when the local node wishes to create a new
commitment for the remote node, it uses its own `revocation_basepoint` and the remote
node's `per_commitment_point` to derive a new `revocationpubkey` for the
commitment. After the remote node reveals the
`per_commitment_secret` used (thereby revoking that commitment), the local node
can then derive the `revocationprivkey`, as it now knows the two secrets
necessary to derive the key (`revocation_basepoint_secret` and
`per_commitment_secret`).

The `per_commitment_point` is generated using elliptic-curve multiplication:

	per_commitment_point = per_commitment_secret * G

And this is used to derive the revocation pubkey from the remote node's
`revocation_basepoint`:

	revocationpubkey = revocation_basepoint * SHA256(revocation_basepoint || per_commitment_point) + per_commitment_point * SHA256(per_commitment_point || revocation_basepoint)

This construction ensures that neither the node providing the
basepoint nor the node providing the `per_commitment_point` can know the
private key without the other node's secret.

The corresponding private key can be derived once the `per_commitment_secret`
is known:

    revocationprivkey = revocation_basepoint_secret * SHA256(revocation_basepoint || per_commitment_point) + per_commitment_secret * SHA256(per_commitment_point || revocation_basepoint)

### Per-commitment Secret Requirements

A node:
  - MUST select an unguessable 256-bit seed for each connection,
  - MUST NOT reveal the seed.

Up to (2^48 - 1) per-commitment secrets can be generated.

The first secret used:
  - MUST be index 281474976710655,
    - and from there, the index is decremented.

The I'th secret P:
  - MUST match the output of this algorithm:
```
generate_from_seed(seed, I):
    P = seed
    for B in 47 down to 0:
        if B set in I:
            flip(B) in P
            P = SHA256(P)
    return P
```

Where "flip(B)" alternates the (B mod 8) bit of the (B div 8)
byte of the value.  So, "flip(0) in e3b0..." is "e2b0...", and
"flip(10) in "e3b0..." is "e3b4...".

The receiving node:
  - MAY store all previous per-commitment secrets.
  - MAY calculate them from a compact representation, as described below.

## Efficient Per-commitment Secret Storage

The receiver of a series of secrets can store them compactly in an
array of 49 (value,index) pairs. Because, for a given secret on a
2^X boundary, all secrets up to the next 2^X boundary can be derived;
and secrets are always received in descending order starting at
`0xFFFFFFFFFFFF`.

In binary, it's helpful to think of any index in terms of a *prefix*,
followed by some trailing 0s. You can derive the secret for any
index that matches this *prefix*.

For example, secret `0xFFFFFFFFFFF0` allows the secrets to be derived for
`0xFFFFFFFFFFF1` through `0xFFFFFFFFFFFF`, inclusive; and secret `0xFFFFFFFFFF08`
allows the secrets to be derived for `0xFFFFFFFFFF09` through `0xFFFFFFFFFF0F`,
inclusive.

This is done using a slight generalization of `generate_from_seed` above:

    # Return I'th secret given base secret whose index has bits..47 the same.
    derive_secret(base, bits, I):
        P = base
        for B in bits - 1 down to 0:
            if B set in I:
                flip(B) in P
                P = SHA256(P)
        return P

Only one secret for each unique prefix need be saved; in effect, the number of
trailing 0s is counted, and this determines where in the storage array the
secret is stored:

    # a.k.a. count trailing 0s
    where_to_put_secret(I):
        for B in 0 to 47:
            if testbit(I) in B == 1:
                return B
        # I = 0, this is the seed.
        return 48

A double-check, that all previous secrets derive correctly, is needed;
if this check fails, the secrets were not generated from the same seed:

    insert_secret(secret, I):
        B = where_to_put_secret(I)

        # This tracks the index of the secret in each bucket across the traversal.
        for b in 0 to B:
            if derive_secret(secret, B, known[b].index) != known[b].secret:
                error The secret for I is incorrect
                return

        # Assuming this automatically extends known[] as required.
        known[B].index = I
        known[B].secret = secret

Finally, if an unknown secret at index `I` needs be derived, it must be
discovered which known secret can be used to derive it. The simplest
method is iterating over all the known secrets, and testing if each
can be used to derive the unknown secret:

    derive_old_secret(I):
        for b in 0 to len(secrets):
            # Mask off the non-zero prefix of the index.
            MASK = ~((1 << b) - 1)
            if (I & MASK) == secrets[b].index:
                return derive_secret(known, i, I)
        error Index 'I' hasn't been received yet.

This looks complicated, but remember that the index in entry `b` has
`b` trailing 0s; the mask and compare simply checks if the index
at each bucket is a prefix of the desired index.

# Appendix B: Funding Transaction Test Vectors

In the following:
 - It's assumed that *local* is the funder.
 - Private keys are displayed as 32 bytes plus a trailing 1 (Bitcoin's convention for "compressed" private keys, i.e. keys for which the public key is compressed).
 - Transaction signatures are all deterministic, using RFC6979 (using HMAC-SHA256). A valid signature MUST sign all inputs and outputs of the relevant transaction (i.e. MUST be created with a `SIGHASH_ALL` [signature hash](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/signature-hash)), unless explicitly stated otherwise. Note that clients MUST send the signature in compact encoding and not in Bitcoin-script format, thus the signature hash byte is not transmitted.

The input for the funding transaction was created using a test chain

# Appendix C: Commitment and HTLC Transaction Test Vectors

In the following:
 - *local* transactions are considered, which implies that all payments to *local* are delayed.
 - It's assumed that *local* is the funder.
 - Private keys are displayed as 32 bytes plus a trailing 1 (Bitcoin's convention for "compressed" private keys, i.e. keys for which the public key is compressed).
 - Transaction signatures are all deterministic, using RFC6979 (using HMAC-SHA256).

To start, common basic parameters for each test vector are defined: the
HTLCs are not used for the first "simple commitment tx with no HTLCs" test,
and HTLCs 5 and 6 are only used in the "same amount and preimage" test.

## Storage Tests

These test the optional compact storage system. In many cases, an
incorrect entry cannot be determined until its parent is revealed: an entry is
specifically corrupted, along with all its children.

For
these tests a seed of `0xFFF...FF` is used, and incorrect entries are
seeded with `0x000...00`.

# Appendix E: Key Derivation Test Vectors

These test the derivation for `localpubkey`, `remotepubkey`, `local_htlcpubkey`, `remote_htlcpubkey`, `local_delayedpubkey`, and
`remote_delayedpubkey` (which use the same formula), as well as the `revocationpubkey`.

All of them use the following secrets (and thus the derived points):

# Appendix F: Commitment and HTLC Transaction Test Vectors (anchors)

The anchor test vectors are based on the test cases as defined in appendix C.
Note that in appendix C, `to_local_msat` and `to_remote_msat` are balances
before subtraction of:
* Commit fee (funder only)
* Anchor outputs (funder only)
* In-flight htlcs

# Appendix G: Commitment and HTLC Transaction Test Vectors (anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx)

The anchor test vectors are based on the test cases as defined in appendix C.
Note that in appendix C, `to_local_msat` and `to_remote_msat` are balances
before subtraction of:
* Commit fee (funder only)
* Anchor outputs (funder only)
* In-flight htlcs
