## Moderation Rules

This document codifies rules to resolve conflicts, spams and harassment among the contributors to the Lightning BOLTs.

In general, we advise everyone to "be excellent to each other", i.e tread every other contributor
as you would like they tread yourself with the same level of civility and courtesy.

As reminder, the Lightning BOLTs is a decentralized open-source project, as such there is no foundation
or BDFL to arbiter conflicts as a perfect impartial party. Trust towards each other among contributors,
including the ones acting as moderators, can only be limited, given that leniency or complacency might
have direct short-term or long-term impact on the Lightning users funds. The Lightning Network has been
out of the beta phase since a while.

Due to those reasons, high standards of transparency must be uphold to avoid "who moderate the moderators"
phenomena. Transparency is critical to building trust in the moderation process and ensuring external accountability.

## Torts

We recognize 2 torts that are disruptive to the collaborative effort to the Lightning BOLTs.

Spamming: the fact of publishing comments or issues not directly related to the Lightning BOLTs
or its contribution process. TODO: improve.

Cyber-harassment: the fact of harassing a contributor by repeated comments or behaviours with the
object or effect of deteriorating their contributing abilities resulting in an alteration of their
physical or mental health.

Only facts happening on the repository, IRC channel, Jitsi can be reported in a moderation
proceeding by a claimant.

TODO: enumerate channels in a strictly exclusive fashion

Any fact happening offline, i.e in a physical space or in a private conservation among contributors
have to be dealt according to the conflict of laws in vigor. This is strictly beyond the scope of the
Lightning BOLTs process.

## Moderatords Role

Moderators should be mindful to prevent self-dealing in the accomplishement of their moderators role.

Moderators should act as an impartial party in its moderation role, i.e showing high standard of
fairness and lack of bias. Moderator should be mindful about conflict of interests they might have
arising from their professional or commercial activitives at large and self-recuse themselves to act
in some matters.

Moderators are nomimnated for 2 years.

TODO: add process for moderators nomimation.

A claimant or defendant has the right to ask recusation of a moderator, if real or perceived bias are existent.
In that situation, another moderator or a senior contributor on a temporal basis only should act in substitution.

## Proceedings

All moderation proceedings must follow the principle of contradictory and give equal chance to a defendant or
claimant to explain his viewpoint on the torts. Both defendant or claimant can be assisted by another contributor
to articulate and prepare their arguments.

It is the responsibility of the moderators to exactly qualify the torts and detailed facts that are charged
on the defendant. The fact must be qualified in one of the 2 listed torts.

In case of a tort impacting the whole contributors to the repository, a moderator should endorse the role of
the claimant for the sake of the whole contributors.

Moderators must hold the defendant's presumption of innocence, until the decision is rendered.

As soon as a moderation proceeding is asked by a claimant, a moderator must open a proceeding under a period of 1 week.

Once a moderator has notified the defendant of the torts, for all sanctions superiors to a 2 weeks ban,
a defendant is granted a period of 2 weeks to prepare a defense.

After the claimant or defendant have explain their viewpoints, the moderator must give their decisions
in a delay of no more than 2 weeks.

Moderators can grant further delays to the claimant or defendant to explain their viewpoint or additional
rounds of explanations, especially in function of the severity of the sanctions or if imperative events arise
(e.g travels). However, moderators are forbidden to compress the minimal delay granted.
