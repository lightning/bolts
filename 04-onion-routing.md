# BOLT #4: Onion Routing Protocol

## Overview

This document describes the construction of an onion routed packet that is
used to route a payment from an _origin node_ to a _final node_. The packet
is routed through a number of intermediate nodes, called _hops_.

The routing schema is based on the
[Sphinx](http://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/Sphinx_Oakland09.pdf)
construction and is extended with a per-hop payload.

Intermediate nodes forwarding the message can verify the integrity of
the packet and can learn which node they should forward the
packet to. They cannot learn which other nodes, besides their
predecessor or successor, are part of the packet's route; nor can they learn
the length of the route or their position within it. The packet is
obfuscated at each hop, to ensure that a network level attacker cannot
associate packets belonging to the same route, i.e. packets belonging
to the same route do not share any correlating information. Notice that this
does not preclude the possibility of packet association by an attacker
via traffic analysis.

The route is constructed by the origin node, which knows the public
keys of each intermediate node. Knowing each intermediate hop's public key
allows the origin node to create a shared secret (using ECDH) for each
intermediate node, including the final recipient node. The shared secret is then
used to generate a _pseudo-random stream_ of bytes (used to obfuscate
the packet) and a number of _keys_ (used to encrypt the payload and
compute the HMACs). The HMACs are then in turn used to ensure the integrity of
the packet at each hop.

This specification describes _version 0_ of the packet format and routing
mechanism.

A node:
  - upon receiving a higher version packet than it implements:
    - MUST report a route failure to the origin node.
    - MUST discard the packet.

# Conventions

There are a number of conventions adhered to throughout this document:

 - The maximum route length is limited to 20 hops.
 - HMAC: the integrity verification of the packet is based on Keyed-Hash
 Message Authentication Code, as defined by the
 [FIPS 198 Standard](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/fips/fips198-1/FIPS-198-1_final.pdf)/[RFC 2104](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2104),
 and using a `SHA256` hashing algorithm.
 - Elliptic curve: for all computations involving elliptic curves, the
   Bitcoin curve is used, as specified in [`secp256k1`](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf).
 - Pseudo-random stream: [`ChaCha20`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7539) is
 used to generate a pseudo-random byte stream. For its generation, a fixed
 null-nonce (`0x0000000000000000`) is used, along with a key derived from a
 shared secret and with a `0x00`-byte stream of the desired output size as the
 message.

 - The terms _origin node_ and _final node_ refer to the initial packet sender
 and the final packet recipient, respectively.
 - The terms _hop_ and _node_ are sometimes used interchangeably, but a _hop_
 usually refers to an intermediate node in the route rather than an end node.
        _origin node_ --> _hop_ --> ... --> _hop_ --> _final node_
 - The term _processing node_ refers to the specific node along the route that is
 currently processing the forwarded packet.
 - The term _peers_ refers only to hops that are direct neighbors (in the
 overlay network): more specifically, _sending peers_ forward packets to
 _receiving peers_.
        _sending peer_ --> _receiving peer_

# Key Generation

A number of encryption and verification keys are derived from the shared secret:

 - _rho_: used as key when generating the pseudo-random byte stream that is used
 to obfuscate the per-hop information
 - _mu_: used during the HMAC generation
 - _um_: used during error reporting

The key generation function takes a key-type (_rho_=`0x72686F`, _mu_=`0x6d75`,
or _um_=`0x756d`) and a 32-byte secret as inputs and returns a 32-byte key.

Keys are generated by computing an HMAC (with `SHA256` as hashing algorithm)
using the appropriate key-type (i.e. _rho_, _mu_, or _um_) as HMAC-key and the
32-byte shared secret as the message. The resulting HMAC is then returned as the
key.

Notice that the key-type does not include a C-style `0x00`-termination-byte,
e.g. the length of the _rho_ key-type is 3 bytes, not 4.

# Pseudo Random Byte Stream

The pseudo-random byte stream is used to obfuscate the packet at each hop of the
path, so that each hop may only recover the address and HMAC of the next hop.
The pseudo-random byte stream is generated by encrypting (using `ChaCha20`) a
`0x00`-byte stream, of the required length, which is initialized with a key
derived from the shared secret and a zero-nonce (`0x00000000000000`).
The use of a fixed nonce is safe, since the keys are never reused.

# Packet Structure

The packet consists of four sections:

 - a `version` byte
 - a 33-byte compressed `secp256k1` `public_key`, used during the shared secret
 generation
 - a 1300-byte `hops_data` consisting of 20 fixed-size packets, each containing
 information to be used by its associated hop during message forwarding
 - a 32-byte `HMAC`, used to verify the packet's integrity

The network format of the packet consists of the individual sections being
serialized into one contiguous byte-stream and then transferred to the packet
recipient. Due to the fixed size of the packet, it need not be prefixed by its
length when transferred over a connection.

The overall structure of the packet is as follows:

1. type: `onion_packet`
2. data:
   * [`1`:`version`]
   * [`33`:`public_key`]
   * [`20*65`:`hops_data`]
   * [`32`:`hmac`]

For this specification (_version 0_), `version` has a constant value of `0x00`.

The `hops_data` field is a structure that holds obfuscations of the next hop's
address, transfer information, and its associated HMAC. It is 1300 bytes long
and has the following structure:

1. type: `hops_data`
2. data:
   * [`1`:`realm`]
   * [`32`:`per_hop`]
   * [`32`:`HMAC`]
   * ...
   * `filler`

Where, the `realm`, `HMAC`, and `per_hop` (of which contents depend on `realm`)
are repeated for each hop; and where, `filler` consists of obfuscated,
deterministically-generated padding, as detailed in
[Filler Generation](#filler-generation). Additionally, `hops_data` is
incrementally obfuscated at each hop.

The `realm` byte determines the format of the `per_hop`; currently, only `realm`
0 is defined, for which the `per_hop` format follows:

1. type: `per_hop` (for `realm` 0)
2. data:
   * [`8`:`short_channel_id`]
   * [`8`:`amt_to_forward`]
   * [`4`:`outgoing_cltv_value`]
   * [`12`:`padding`]

Using the `per_hop`, the origin node is able to precisely specify the path and
structure of the HTLCs forwarded at each hop. As the `per_hop` is protected
under the packet-wide HMAC, the information it contains is fully authenticated
with each pair-wise relationship between the HTLC sender (origin node) and each
hop in the path.

Using this end-to-end authentication, in addition to
cross-checking the HTLC parameters with the `per_hop`'s specified values, each
hop is able to ensure the sending peer hasn't forwarded it an
ill-crafted HTLC.

Field descriptions:

   * `short_channel_id`: The ID of the channel used to route the message;
     the receiving peer is the other end of the channel.

   * `amt_to_forward`: The amount, in millisatoshis, to forward to the next
     receiving peer specified within the routing information.

     This value amount MUST include the origin node's computed _fee_ for the
     receiving peer. When processing an incoming Sphinx packet, along with the HTLC
     message that it is encapsulated within, if the following inequality doesn't hold,
     then the HTLC should be rejected; as this indicates a prior hop has
     deviated from the specified parameters:

        incoming_htlc_amt - fee >= amt_to_forward

     Where `fee` is either calculated according to the receiving peer's advertised fee
     schema (as described in [BOLT 7](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/07-routing-gossip.md#htlc-fees))
     or is 0, if the processing node is the final node.

   * `outgoing_cltv_value`: The CLTV value that the _outgoing_ HTLC carrying
     the packet should have.

        cltv_expiry - cltv_expiry_delta >= outgoing_cltv_value

     Inclusion of this field allows a hop to both authenticate the information
     specified by the origin node, and the parameters of the HTLC forwarded,
	 and ensure the origin node is using the current `cltv_expiry_delta` value.
     If there is no next hop, `cltv_expiry_delta` is 0.
     If the values don't correspond, then the HTLC should be failed and rejected as
     this indicates that either a forwarding node has tampered with the intended HTLC
     values, or the origin node has an obsolete `cltv_expiry_delta` value.
     The hop MUST be consistent in responding to an unexpected
     `outgoing_cltv_value`, whether it is the final node or not, to avoid
     leaking its position in the route.

   * `padding`: This field is for future use and also for ensuring that future non-0-`realm`
     `per_hop`s won't change the overall `hops_data` size.

When forwarding HTLCs, nodes MUST construct the outgoing HTLC as specified within
`per_hop` above; otherwise, deviation from the specified HTLC parameters
may lead to extraneous routing failure.

## Payload for the Last Node

When building the route, the origin node MUST use a payload for
the final node with the following values:
* `outgoing_cltv_value`: set to the final expiry specified by the recipient
* `amt_to_forward`: set to the final amount specified by the recipient

This allows the final node to check these values and return errors if needed,
but it also eliminates the possibility of probing attacks by the second-to-last
node. Such attacks could, otherwise, attempt to discover if the receiving peer is the
last one by re-sending HTLCs with different amounts/expiries.
The final node will extract its onion payload from the HTLC it has received and
compare its values against those of the HTLC. See the
[Returning Errors](#returning-errors) section below for more details.

If not for the above, since it need not forward payments, the final node could
simply discard its payload.

# Packet Construction

In the following example, it's assumed that a _sending node_ (origin node),
`n_0`, wants to route a packet to a _receiving node_ (final node), `n_r`.
First, the sender computes a route `{n_0, n_1, ..., n_{r-1}, n_r}`, where `n_0`
is the sender itself and `n_r` is the final recipient. The nodes `n_i` and
`n_{i+1}` MUST be peers in the overlay network route. The sender then gathers the
public keys for `n_1` to `n_r` and generates a random 32-byte `sessionkey`.
Optionally, the sender may pass in _associated data_, i.e. data that the
packet commits to but that is not included in the packet itself. Associated
data will be included in the HMACs and must match the associated data provided
during integrity verification at each hop.

Next, for each hop along the route, the sender computes an
_ephemeral public key_, a _shared secret_, and a _blinding factor_. The blinding
factor is used at each hop to blind the ephemeral public key for the next hop.
The hop receiving the header will perform ECDH with the ephemeral public key
and its own private key in order to derive the same shared secret.
However, when generating the packet, the sending node doesn't have access to the
other nodes' private keys. So instead, it uses the commutative property of
multiplication to blind each hop's public key with all previous blinding
factors and performs ECDH, using each hop's blinded public key and the
`sessionkey`.

The transformations at hop `k` are as follows:

 - The shared secret `ss_k` is computed by first blinding the hop's public key
 `nodepk_k` with all previous blinding factors `{b_1, ..., b_{k-1}}` (if any),
 and second, executing ECDH with the blinded public key and the `sessionkey`.
 - The blinding factor is the `SHA256` hash of the concatenation between the
 hop's public key `nodepk_k` and its shared secret `ss_k`. Before
 concatenation, the hop's public key is serialized in the compressed format.
 - The ephemeral public key `epk_k` is computed by blinding the hop's sending
 peer's ephemeral public key `epk_{k-1}` with the hop's sending peer's blinding
 factor `b_{k-1}`.

This recursive algorithm is initialized by setting the first hop's (`k=1`)
ephemeral public key to the public key corresponding to the `sessionkey`, i.e.
`secp256k1` is used to derive a public key for the randomly selected
`sessionkey`.

The origin node then iteratively computes the ephemeral public keys, shared
secrets, and blinding factors for hops `{n_2, ..., n_r}`.

Once the sender has all the required information above, it can construct the
packet. Constructing a packet routed over `r` hops requires `r` 32-byte
ephemeral public keys, `r` 32-byte shared secrets, `r` 32-byte blinding factors,
and `r` 65-byte `per_hop` payloads. The construction returns a single 1366-byte
packet along with the first receiving peer's address.

The packet construction is performed in the reverse order of the route, i.e.
the last hop's operations are applied first.

The packet is initialized with 1366 `0x00`-bytes.

A 65-byte filler is generated (see [Filler Generation](#filler-generation))
using the shared secret.

For each hop in the route, in reverse order, the sender applies the
following operations:

 - The _rho_-key and _mu_-key are generated using the hop's shared secret.
 - The `hops_data` field is right-shifted by 65 bytes, discarding the last 65
 bytes that exceed its 1300 byte size.
 - The `version`, `short_channel_id`, `amt_to_forward`, `outgoing_cltv_value`,
   `padding`, and `HMAC` are copied into the following 65 bytes.
 - The _rho_-key is used to generate 1300 bytes of pseudo-random byte stream
 which is then applied, with `XOR`, to the `hops_data` field.
 - If this is the last hop, i.e. the first iteration, then the tail of the
 `hops_data` field is overwritten with the routing information `filler`.
 - The next HMAC is computed (with the _mu_-key as HMAC-key) over the
 concatenated `hops_data` and associated data.

The resulting final HMAC value is the HMAC that will be used by the first
receiving peer in the route.

The packet generation returns a serialized packet that contains the `version`
byte, the ephemeral pubkey for the first hop, the HMAC for the first hop, and
the obfuscated `hops_data`.

The following Go code is an example implementation of the packet construction:

```Go
func NewOnionPacket(paymentPath []*btcec.PublicKey, sessionKey *btcec.PrivateKey,
	hopsData []HopData, assocData []byte) (*OnionPacket, error) {

	numHops := len(paymentPath)
	hopEphemeralPubKeys := make([]*btcec.PublicKey, numHops)
	hopSharedSecrets := make([][sha256.Size]byte, numHops)
	hopBlindingFactors := make([][sha256.Size]byte, numHops)

	hopEphemeralPubKeys[0] = sessionKey.PubKey()
	hopSharedSecrets[0] = generateSharedSecret(paymentPath[0], sessionKey)
	hopBlindingFactors[0] = computeBlindingFactor(hopEphemeralPubKeys[0], hopSharedSecrets[0][:])

	for i := 1; i <= numHops-1; i++ {
		hopEphemeralPubKeys[i] = blindGroupElement(hopEphemeralPubKeys[i-1],
			hopBlindingFactors[i-1][:])
		yToX := blindGroupElement(paymentPath[i], sessionKey.D.Bytes())
		hopSharedSecrets[i] = sha256.Sum256(multiScalarMult(yToX, hopBlindingFactors[:i]).SerializeCompressed())

		hopBlindingFactors[i] = computeBlindingFactor(hopEphemeralPubKeys[i],
			hopSharedSecrets[i][:])
	}

	// Generate the padding, called "filler strings" in the paper.
	filler := generateHeaderPadding("rho", numHops, hopDataSize, hopSharedSecrets)

	// Allocate and initialize fields to zero-filled slices
	var mixHeader [routingInfoSize]byte
	var nextHmac [hmacSize]byte

	// Compute the routing information for each hop along with a
	// MAC of the routing information using the shared key for that hop.
	for i := numHops - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		rhoKey := generateKey("rho", hopSharedSecrets[i])
		muKey := generateKey("mu", hopSharedSecrets[i])

		hopsData[i].HMAC = nextHmac

		// Shift and obfuscate routing information
		streamBytes := generateCipherStream(rhoKey, numStreamBytes)

		rightShift(mixHeader[:], hopDataSize)
		buf := &bytes.Buffer{}
		hopsData[i].Encode(buf)
		copy(mixHeader[:], buf.Bytes())
		xor(mixHeader[:], mixHeader[:], streamBytes[:routingInfoSize])

		// These need to be overwritten, so every node generates a correct padding
		if i == numHops-1 {
			copy(mixHeader[len(mixHeader)-len(filler):], filler)
		}

		packet := append(mixHeader[:], assocData...)
		nextHmac = calcMac(muKey, packet)
	}

	packet := &OnionPacket{
		Version:      0x00,
		EphemeralKey: hopEphemeralPubKeys[0],
		RoutingInfo:  mixHeader,
		HeaderMAC:    nextHmac,
	}
	return packet, nil
}
```

# Packet Forwarding

This specification is limited to `version` `0` packets; however, the structure
of future versions may change.
Upon receiving a packet, a processing node compares the version byte of the
packet with its own supported versions and aborts the connection if the packet
specifies a version number that it doesn't support.
For packets with supported version numbers, the processing node first parses the
packet into its individual fields.

Next, the processing node computes the shared secret using the private key
corresponding to its own public key and the ephemeral key from the packet, as
described in [Shared Secret](#shared-secret).

The above requirements prevent any hop along the route from retrying a payment
multiple times, in an attempt to track a payment's progress via traffic
analysis. Note that disabling such probing could be accomplished using a log of
previous shared secrets or HMACs, which could be forgotten once the HTLC would
not be accepted anyway (i.e. after `outgoing_cltv_value` has passed). Such a log
may use a probabilistic data structure, but it MUST rate-limit commitments as
necessary, in order to constrain the worst-case storage requirements or false
positives of this log.

Next, the processing node uses the shared secret to compute a _mu_-key, which it
in turn uses to compute the HMAC of the `hops_data`. The resulting HMAC is then
compared against the packet's HMAC.

Comparison of the computed HMAC and the packet's HMAC MUST be
time-constant to avoid information leaks.

At this point, the processing node can generate a _rho_-key and a _gamma_-key.

The routing information is then deobfuscated, and the information about the
next hop is extracted.
To do so, the processing node copies the `hops_data` field, appends 65 `0x00`-bytes,
generates 1365 pseudo-random bytes (using the _rho_-key), and applies the result
,using `XOR`, to the copy of the `hops_data`.
The first 65 bytes of the resulting routing information become the `per_hop`
field used for the next hop. The next 1300 bytes are the `hops_data` for the
outgoing packet.

A special `per_hop` `HMAC` value of 32 `0x00`-bytes indicates that the currently
processing hop is the intended recipient and that the packet should not be forwarded.

If the HMAC does not indicate route termination, and if the next hop is a peer of the
processing node; then the new packet is assembled. Packet assembly is accomplished
by blinding the ephemeral key with the processing node's public key along with the
shared secret and by serializing the `hops_data`.
The resulting packet is then forwarded to the addressed peer.

## Requirements

The processing node:
  - if the ephemeral public key is NOT on the `secp256k1` curve:
    - MUST abort processing the packet.
    - MUST report a route failure to the origin node.
  - if the packet has previously been forwarded or locally redeemed, i.e. the
  packet contains duplicate routing information to a previously received packet:
    - if preimage is known:
      - MAY immediately redeem the HTLC using the preimage.
    - otherwise:
      - MUST abort processing and report a route failure.
  - if the computed HMAC and the packet's HMAC differ:
    - MUST abort processing.
    - MUST report a route failure.
  - if the `realm` is unknown:
    - MUST drop the packet.
    - MUST signal a route failure.
  - MUST address the packet to another peer that is its direct neighbor.
  - if the processing node does not have a peer with the matching address:
    - MUST drop the packet.
    - MUST signal a route failure.

# Shared Secret

The origin node performs ECDH with each hop of the route, in order to establish a secret.
A new _sessionkey_, a 32-byte EC private key, is generated for each message.
The shared secret builder function takes a public key and a 32-byte secret
,as inputs, and returns a 32-byte secret, as output.

During the packet generation phase, the secret is the `sessionkey`, and the
public key is the hop's public key, which is blinded by all previous blinding
factors.
During the processing phase, the secret is the hop's (processing node's) private
key, while the public key is the ephemeral public key from the packet, which has
been incrementally blinded by its predecessors.

The public key is multiplied by the secret, using the `secp256k1` curve.
The DER compressed representation of the multiplication result is serialized and
hashed using `SHA256`, and the resulting hash is returned as the shared secret.
Notice that this is the ECDH variant implemented in `libsecp256k1`.

# Filler Generation

Upon receiving a packet, the processing node extracts the information destined
for it from the route information and the per-hop payload.
The extraction is done by deobfuscating and left-shifting the field.
This would make the field shorter at each hop, allowing an attacker to deduce the
route length. For this reason, the field is pre-padded before forwarding.
Since the padding is part of the HMAC, the origin node will have to pre-generate an
identical padding (to that which each hop will generate) in order to compute the
HMACs correctly for each hop.
The filler is also used to pad the field-length, in the case that the selected
route is shorter than the maximum allowed route length of 20.

Before deobfuscating the `hops_data`, the processing node pads it with 65
`0x00`-bytes, such that the total length is `(20 + 1) * 65`.
It then generates the pseudo-random byte stream, of matching length, and applies
it with `XOR` to the `hops_data`.
This deobfuscates the information destined for it, while simultaneously
obfuscating the added `0x00`-bytes at the end.

In order to compute the correct HMAC, the origin node has to pre-generate the
`hops_data` for each hop, including the incrementally obfuscated padding added
by each hop. This incrementally obfuscated padding is referred to as the
`filler`.

The following example code shows how the filler is generated in Go:

```Go
func generateFiller(key string, numHops int, hopSize int, sharedSecrets [][sharedSecretSize]byte) []byte {
	fillerSize := uint((numMaxHops + 1) * hopSize)
	filler := make([]byte, fillerSize)

	// The last hop does not obfuscate, it's not forwarding anymore.
	for i := 0; i < numHops-1; i++ {

		// Left-shift the field
		copy(filler[:], filler[hopSize:])

		// Zero-fill the last hop
		copy(filler[len(filler)-hopSize:], bytes.Repeat([]byte{0x00}, hopSize))

		// Generate pseudo-random byte stream
		streamKey := generateKey(key, sharedSecrets[i])
		streamBytes := generateCipherStream(streamKey, fillerSize)

		// Obfuscate
		xor(filler, filler, streamBytes)
	}

	// Cut filler down to the correct length (numHops+1)*hopSize
	// bytes will be prepended by the packet generation.
	return filler[(numMaxHops-numHops+2)*hopSize:]
}
```

Notice that this example implementation is for demonstration purposes only; the
`filler` can be generated much more efficiently.
The last hop need not obfuscate the `filler`, since it won't forward the packet
any further and thus need not extract an HMAC either.

# Blinding EC Points

In order to vary the ephemeral public key (the EC point) between hops, it's
blinded at each hop.
The inputs for the blinding process are the EC point to be blinded, the hop's
public key, and a 32-byte shared secret. The output is a single EC point, which
represents the blinded element.

Blinding is accomplished by computing a blinding factor from the hop's public
key and the shared secret for that hop.
The blinding factor is the computed `SHA256` hash value of the result of
serializing the hop's public key into its compressed format and appending the
shared secret.
The blinded EC point, in turn, is the result of the scalar multiplication of the
EC point and the blinding factor.

# Returning Errors

The onion routing protocol includes a simple mechanism for returning encrypted
error messages to the origin node.
The returned error messages may be failures reported by any hop, including the
final node.
The format of the forward packet is not usable for the return path, since no hop
besides the origin has access to the information required for its generation.
Note that these error messages are not reliable, as they are not placed on-chain
due to the possibility of hop failure.

Intermediate hops store the shared secret from the forward path and reuse it to
obfuscate any corresponding return packet during each hop.
In addition, each node locally stores data regarding its own sending peer in the
route, so it knows where to return-forward any eventual return packets.
The node generating the error message (_erring node_) builds a return packet
consisting of the following fields:

1. data:
   * [`32`:`hmac`]
   * [`2`:`failure_len`]
   * [`failure_len`:`failuremsg`]
   * [`2`:`pad_len`]
   * [`pad_len`:`pad`]

Where `hmac` is an HMAC authenticating the remainder of the packet, with a key
generated using the above process, with key type `um`, `failuremsg` as defined
below, and `pad` as the extra bytes used to conceal length.

The erring node then generates a new key, using the key type `ammag`.
This key is then used to generate a pseudo-random stream, which is in turn
applied to the packet using `XOR`.

The obfuscation step is repeated by every hop along the return path.
Upon receiving a return packet, each hop generates its `ammag`, generates the
pseudo-random byte stream, and applies the result to the return packet before
return-forwarding it.

The origin node is able to detect that it's the intended final recipient of the
return message, because of course, it was the originator of the corresponding
forward packet.
When an origin node receives an error message matching a transfer it initiated
(i.e. it cannot return-forward the error any further) it generates the `ammag`
and `um` keys for each hop in the route.
It then iteratively decrypts the error message, using each hop's `ammag`
key, and computes the HMAC, using each hop's `um` key.
The origin node can detect the sender of the error message by matching the
`hmac` field with the computed HMAC.

The association between the forward and return packets is handled outside of
this onion routing protocol, e.g. via association with an HTLC in a payment
channel.

### Requirements

The _erring node_:
  - SHOULD set `pad` such that the `failure_len` plus `pad_len` is equal to 256.
    - Note: this value is 118 bytes longer than the longest currently-defined
    message.

The _origin node_:
  - once the return message has been decrypted:
    - SHOULD store a copy of the message.
    - SHOULD continue decrypting, until the loop has been repeated 20 times.
    - SHOULD use constant `ammag` and `um` keys to obfuscate the route length.

## Failure Messages

The failure message encapsulated in `failuremsg` has an identical format as
a normal message: a 2-byte type `failure_code` followed by data applicable
to that type. Below is a list of the currently supported `failure_code`
values, followed by their use case requirements.

Notice that the `failure_code`s are not of the same type as other message types,
defined in other BOLTs, as they are not sent directly on the transport layer
but are instead wrapped inside return packets.
The numeric values for the `failure_code` may therefore reuse values, that are
also assigned to other message types, without any danger of causing collisions.

The top byte of `failure_code` can be read as a set of flags:
* 0x8000 (BADONION): unparsable onion encrypted by sending peer
* 0x4000 (PERM): permanent failure (otherwise transient)
* 0x2000 (NODE): node failure (otherwise channel)
* 0x1000 (UPDATE): new channel update enclosed

### Requirements

An _erring node_:
  - MUST select one of the above error codes when creating an error message.
  - MUST include the appropriate data for that particular error type.
  - if there is more than one error:
    - SHOULD select the first error it encounters from the list above.

Any _erring node_ MAY:
  - if the `realm` byte is unknown:
    - return an `invalid_realm` error.
  - if an otherwise unspecified transient error occurs for the entire node:
    - return a `temporary_node_failure` error.
  - if an otherwise unspecified permanent error occurs for the entire node:
    - return a `permanent_node_failure` error.
  - if a node has requirements advertised in its `node_announcement` `features`,
  which were NOT included in the onion:
    - return a `required_node_feature_missing` error.

A _forwarding node_ MAY, but a _final node_ MUST NOT:
  - if the onion `version` byte is unknown:
    - return an `invalid_onion_version` error.
  - if the onion HMAC is incorrect:
    - return an `invalid_onion_hmac` error.
  - if the ephemeral key in the onion is unparsable:
    - return an `invalid_onion_key` error.
  - if, during forwarding to its receiving peer, an otherwise unspecified,
  transient error occurs in the outgoing channel (e.g. channel capacity reached,
  too many in-flight HTLCs, etc.):
    - return a `temporary_channel_failure` error.
  - if an otherwise unspecified, permanent error occurs during forwarding to its
  receiving peer (e.g. channel recently closed):
    - return a `permanent_channel_failure` error.
  - if the outgoing channel has requirements advertised in its
  `channel_announcement`'s `features`, which were NOT included in the onion:
    - return a `required_channel_feature_missing` error.
  - if the receiving peer specified by the onion is NOT known:
    - return an `unknown_next_peer` error.
  - if the HTLC amount is less than the currently specified minimum amount:
    - report the amount of the incoming HTLC and the current channel setting for
    the outgoing channel.
    - return an `amount_below_minimum` error.
  - if the HTLC does NOT pay a sufficient fee:
    - report the amount of the incoming HTLC and the current channel setting for
    the outgoing channel.
    - return a `fee_insufficient` error.
  - if the `outgoing_cltv_value` does NOT match the `update_add_htlc`'s
  `cltv_expiry` minus the `cltv_expiry_delta` for the outgoing channel:
    - report the `cltv_expiry` and the current channel setting for the outgoing
    channel.
    - return an `incorrect_cltv_expiry` error.
  - if the `cltv_expiry` is unreasonably near the present:
    - report the current channel setting for the outgoing channel.
    - return an `expiry_too_soon` error.
  - if the `cltv_expiry` is unreasonably far in the future:
    - return an `expiry_too_far` error.
  - if the channel is disabled:
    - report the current channel setting for the outgoing channel.
    - return a `channel_disabled` error.

An _intermediate hop_ MUST NOT, but the _final node_:
  - if the payment hash has already been paid:
    - MAY treat the payment hash as unknown.
    - MAY succeed in accepting the HTLC.
  - if the amount paid is less than the amount expected:
    - MUST fail the HTLC.
  - if the payment hash is unknown:
    - MUST fail the HTLC.
    - MUST return an `unknown_payment_hash` error.
  - if the amount paid is more than twice the amount expected:
    - SHOULD fail the HTLC.
    - SHOULD return an `incorrect_payment_amount` error.
      - Note: this allows the origin node to reduce information leakage by
      altering the amount while not allowing for accidental gross overpayment.
  - if the `cltv_expiry` value is unreasonably near the present:
    - MUST fail the HTLC.
    - MUST return a `final_expiry_too_soon` error.
  - if the `outgoing_cltv_value` does NOT correspond with the `cltv_expiry` from
  the final node's HTLC:
    - MUST return `final_incorrect_cltv_expiry` error.
  - if the `amt_to_forward` is greater than the `incoming_htlc_amt` from the
  final node's HTLC:
    - MUST return a `final_incorrect_htlc_amount` error.

## Receiving Failure Codes

### Requirements

The _origin node_:
  - MUST ignore any extra bytes in `failuremsg`.
  - if the _final node_ is returning the error:
    - if the PERM bit is set:
      - SHOULD fail the payment.
    - otherwise:
      - if the error code is understood and valid:
        - MAY retry the payment. In particular, `final_expiry_too_soon` can
        occur if the block height has changed since sending, and in this case
        `temporary_node_failure` could resolve within a few seconds.
  - otherwise, an _intermediate hop_ is returning the error:
    - if the NODE bit is set:
      - SHOULD remove all channels connected with the erring node from
      consideration.
    - if the PERM bit is NOT set:
      - SHOULD restore the channels as it receives new `channel_update`s.
    - otherwise:
      - if UPDATE is set, AND the `channel_update` is valid and more recent
      than the `channel_update` used to send the payment:
        - if `channel_update` should NOT have caused the failure:
          - MAY treat the `channel_update` as invalid.
        - otherwise:
          - SHOULD apply the `channel_update`.
        - MAY queue the `channel_update` for broadcast.
      - otherwise:
        - SHOULD eliminate the channel outgoing from the erring node from
        consideration.
        - if the PERM bit is NOT set:
          - SHOULD restore the channel as it receives new `channel_update`s.
    - SHOULD then retry routing and sending the payment.
  - MAY use the data specified in the various failure types for debugging
  purposes.

The HMAC is omitted in the following `hop_data`, since it's likely to be filled
by the onion construction. Hence, the values below are the `realm`, the
`short_channel_id`, the `amt_to_forward`, the `outgoing_cltv`, and the 16-byte
`padding`. They were initialized by byte-filling the `short_channel_id` to the
each hop's respective position in the route and then, starting at 0, setting
`amt_to_forward` and `outgoing_cltv` to the same route position.
