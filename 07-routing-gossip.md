# BOLT #7: P2P Node and Channel Discovery

This specification describes simple node discovery, channel discovery and channel update mechanisms which do not rely on a third-party to disseminate the information.

Node and channel discovery serve two different purposes:

 - Channel discovery allows the creation and maintenance of a local view of the network's topology such that the node can discover routes to the desired destination.
 - Node discovery allows nodes to broadcast their ID, host and port, such that other nodes can open connections and establish payment channels.
 
Peers in the network exchange `channel_announcement` messages that contain information about new channels between two nodes.  They can also exchange `node_announcement` messages which supply additional information about nodes, and `channel_update` messages which update information about a channel.

There can only be one valid `channel_announcement` for any channel,
but multiple `node_announcement` messages are possible (to update node
information), and at least two `channel_update` messages are expected.

## The `announcement_signatures` message
This is a direct message between two endpoints of a channel and serves as an opt-in mechanism to allow the announcement of the channel to the rest of the network.
It contains the necessary signatures by the sender to construct the `channel_announcement` message.

1. type: 259 (`announcement_signatures`)
2. data:
    * [32:channel-id]
    * [8:short-channel-id]
    * [64:node-signature]
    * [64:bitcoin-signature]

The willingness of the endpoints to announce the channel is signaled during the connection setup by setting a `channels_public` bit in the `localfeatures` field.

### Requirements

If both endpoints have signaled that they'd like to publish the channel then the `announcement_signatures` message MUST be sent, otherwise they MUST NOT be sent.

If sent, `announcement_signatures` messages MUST NOT be sent until `funding_locked` has been sent, and the funding transaction is has at least 6 confirmations.

The `short-channel-id` is the unique description of the funding transaction.
It is constructed with the most significant 3 bytes as the block
height, the next 3 bytes indicating the transaction index within the
block, and the least significant two bytes indicating the output
index which pays to the channel.

The `announcement_signatures` message is created by constructing a `channel_announcement` message corresponding to the newly established channel, and sign it with the secrets matching their `node-id` and `bitcoin-key`, and send them using an `announcement_signatures`.
The recipient MAY fail the channel if the `node-signature` or `bitcoin-signature` is incorrect.
The recipient SHOULD queue the `channel_announcement` message for its peers if it has sent and received a valid `announcement_signatures` message.

On reconnection, a node SHOULD retransmit the `announcement_signatures` message if it has not received an `announcement_signatures` message, and MUST respond to the first `announcement_signatures` message after reconnection with its own `announcement_signatures` message.

## The `channel_announcement` message

This message contains ownership information about a channel.  It ties
each on-chain Bitcoin key to the lightning node key, and vice-versa.
The channel is not really usable until at least one side has announced
its fee levels and expiry using `channel_update`.

In order to prove the existence of channel between `node-1` and
`node-2` we need to:

1. Prove that the funding transaction pays to `bitcoin-key-1` and
   `bitcoin-key-2`.
2. Prove `node-1` owns `bitcoin-key-1`
3. Prove `node-2` owns `bitcoin-key-2`

The first one is done by assuming that all nodes know the unspent
transaction outputs, and thus can find the output given by
`short-channel-id` and validate that it is indeed a P2WSH funding
transaction output as to those keys specified in
[BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output).

The second two are done by explicit signatures (`bitcoin-signature-1`
and `bitcoin-signature-2`, generated by each `bitcoin-key` and signing
the corresponding `node-id`.

We also need to prove that `node-1` and `node-2` both agree on this
announcement message; that is done by having a signature from each
`node-id` signing the message (`node-signature-1` and
`node-signature-2`).

1. type: 256 (`channel_announcement`)
2. data:
    * [64:node-signature-1]
    * [64:node-signature-2]
    * [64:bitcoin-signature-1]
    * [64:bitcoin-signature-2]
    * [8:short-channel-id]
    * [33:node-id-1]
    * [33:node-id-2]
    * [33:bitcoin-key-1]
    * [33:bitcoin-key-2]
    * [2:len]
    * [len:features]

### Requirements

The creating node MUST set `short-channel-id` to refer to the confirmed
funding transaction as specified in [BOLT #2](02-peer-protocol.md#the-funding_locked-message).  The corresponding output MUST be a
P2WSH as described in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output).

The creating node MUST set `node-id-1` and `node-id-2` to the public
keys of the two nodes who are operating the channel, such that
`node-id-1` is the numerically-lesser of the two DER encoded keys sorted in
ascending numerical order, and MUST set `bitcoin-key-1` and
`bitcoin-key-2` to `funding-pubkey`s of `node-id-1` and `node-id-2`
respectively.

The creating node MUST compute the double-SHA256 hash `h` of the message, starting at offset 256, up to the end of the message.
Thus the hash skips the 4 signatures, but hashes the rest of the message, including any future fields appended to the end.
`node-signature-1` and `node-signature-2` MUST be valid signatures of the hash `h` using the secret associated with `node-id-1` and `node-id-2` respectively.
`bitcoin-signature-1` and `bitcoin-signature-2` MUST be valid signatures of the hash `h` using the secret associated with `bitcoin-key-1` and `bitcoin-key-2` respectively.

The creating node SHOULD set `len` to the minimum length required to
hold the `features` bits it sets.

The receiving node MUST ignore the message if the output specified
by `short-channel-id` does not
correspond to a P2WSH using `bitcoin-key-1` and `bitcoin-key-2` as
specified in [BOLT #3](03-transactions.md#funding-transaction-output).
The receiving node MUST ignore the message if this output is spent.

Otherwise, the receiving node SHOULD fail the connection if
`bitcoin-signature-1`, `bitcoin-signature-2`, `node-signature-1` or
`node-signature-2` are invalid or not correct.

Otherwise, if `node-id-1` or `node-id-2` are blacklisted, it SHOULD
ignore the message.

Otherwise, if the transaction referred to was not previously announced
as a channel, the receiving node SHOULD queue the message for
rebroadcasting, but MAY choose not to for messages longer than
the minimum expected length.  If it has previously received a valid
`channel_announcement` for the same transaction in the same block, but
different `node-id-1` or `node-id-2`, it SHOULD blacklist the
previous message's `node-id-1` and `node-id-2` as well as this
`node-id-1` and `node-id-2` and forget channels connected to them,
otherwise it SHOULD store this `channel_announcement`.

The receiving node SHOULD NOT route through a channel which has an
unknown `feature` bit set which is even.

The receiving node SHOULD forget a channel once its funding output has
been spent or reorganized out.

### Rationale

Requiring both nodes to sign indicates they are both willing to route
other payments via this node (ie. take part of the public network).
Requiring the Bitcoin signatures proves they control the channel.

The blacklisting of conflicting nodes means that we disallow multiple
different announcements: no node should ever do this, as it implies
that keys have leaked.

While channels shouldn't be advertised before they are sufficiently
deep, the requirement against rebroadcasting only applies if the
transaction hasn't moved to a different block.

To avoid having to store excessive-sized messages, yet allow
reasonable expansion in future, nodes are allowed to restrict
rebroadcasting (perhaps statistically).

New channel features are possible in future; backwards compatible (or
optional) ones will have odd feature bits, incompatible ones will have
even feature bits (["It's OK to be odd!"](00-introduction.md#glossary-and-terminology-guide).  These will be propagated by nodes even if they
can't use the announcements themselves.

## The `node_announcement` message

This allows a node to indicate extra data associated with it, in
addition to its public key.  To avoid trivial denial of service attacks,
nodes for which a channel is not already known are ignored.

1. type: 257 (`node_announcement`)
2. data:
   * [64:signature]
   * [4:timestamp]
   * [33:node-id]
   * [3:rgb-color]
   * [32:alias]
   * [2:flen]
   * [flen:features]
   * [2:addrlen]
   * [addrlen:addresses]

The `timestamp` allows ordering in the case of multiple announcements;
the `rgb-color` and `alias` allow
intelligence services to give their nodes cool monikers like IRATEMONK
and WISTFULTOLL and use the color black.

`addresses` allows the node to announce its willingness to accept
incoming network connections: it contains series of `address
descriptor`s for connecting to the node.  The first byte describes the
address type, followed by the appropriate number of bytes for that type.

The following `address descriptor` types are defined:

1. `0`: padding.  data = none (length 0).
1. `1`: IPv4. data = `[4:ipv4-addr][2:port]` (length 6)
2. `2`: IPv6. data = `[16:ipv6-addr][2:port]` (length 18)

### Requirements

The creating node MUST set `timestamp` to be greater than any previous
`node_announcement` it has created.  It MAY base it on a UNIX
timestamp.  It MUST set `signature` to the signature of
the double-SHA256 of the entire remaining packet after `signature` using the
key given by `node-id`.  It MAY set `alias` and `rgb-color` to customize their node's appearance in maps and graphs, where the first byte of `rgb` is the red value, the second byte is the green value and the last byte is the blue value.  It MUST set `alias` to a valid UTF-8 string, with any `alias` bytes following equal to zero.

The creating node SHOULD fill `addresses` with an address descriptor
for each public network address which expects incoming connections,
and MUST set `addrlen` to the number of bytes in `addresses`.
Non-zero typed address descriptors MUST be placed in ascending order;
any number of zero-typed address descriptors MAY be placed anywhere,
but SHOULD only be used for aligning fields following `addresses`.

The creating node MUST NOT create a type 1 or type 2 address
descriptor with `port` equal to zero, and SHOULD ensure `ipv4-addr`
and `ipv6-addr` are routable addresses.  The creating node MUST NOT include
more than one `address descriptor` of the same type.

The creating node SHOULD set `flen` to the minimum length required to
hold the `features` bits it sets.

The receiving node SHOULD fail the connection if `node-id` is not a valid
compressed public key, and MUST NOT further process the message.

The receiving node SHOULD fail the connection if `signature` is not a
valid signature using `node-id` of the double-SHA256 of the entire
message following the `signature` field (including unknown fields
following `alias`), and MUST NOT further process the message.

The receiving node SHOULD ignore the first `address descriptor` which
does not match the types defined above.  The receiving node SHOULD
fail the connection if `addrlen` is insufficient to hold the address
descriptors of the known types.

The receiving node SHOULD ignore the message if `node-id` is not
previously known from a `channel_announcement` message, or if
`timestamp` is not greater than the last-received
`node_announcement` from this `node-id`.  Otherwise, if the
`timestamp` is greater than the last-received `node_announcement` from
this `node-id` the receiving node SHOULD queue the message for
rebroadcasting, but MAY choose not to for messages longer than
the minimum expected length.

The receiving node SHOULD NOT connect to a node which has an unknown
`feature` bit set in the `node_announcement` which is even.

The receiving node MAY use `rgb` and `alias` to reference nodes in interfaces, but SHOULD insinuate their self-signed origin.

### Rationale

New node features are possible in future; backwards compatible (or
optional) ones will have odd feature bits, incompatible ones will have
even feature bits.  These will be propagated by nodes even if they
can't use the announcements themselves.

New address types can be added in future; as address descriptors have
to be ordered in ascending order so they will be safely ignored.
Future fields beyond `addresses` can still be added, optionally with
padding within `addresses` if they require certain alignment.

## The `channel_update` message

After a channel has been initially announced, each side independently
announces its fees and minimum expiry for HTLCs.  It uses the 8-byte
channel shortid which matches the `channel_announcement` and one byte
to indicate which end this is.  It can do this multiple times, if
it wants to change fees.

1. type: 258 (`channel_update`)
2. data:
    * [64:signature]
    * [8:short-channel-id]
    * [4:timestamp]
    * [2:flags]
    * [2:cltv-expiry-delta]
    * [4:htlc-minimum-msat]
    * [4:fee-base-msat]
    * [4:fee-proportional-millionths]

The flags bitfield is used to indicate the direction of the channel this update concerns, i.e., it identifies the node that this update originated from, and signal various options concerning the channel.
The following table specifies the meaning of the individual bits:

| Bit Position  | Name        | Meaning                          |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0             | `direction` | Direction this update refers to. |
| 1             | `disable`   | Disable the channel.             |

### Requirements

The creating node MUST set `signature` to the signature of the
double-SHA256 of the entire remaining packet after `signature` using its own `node-id`.

The creating node MUST set `short-channel-id` to match those in the already-sent `channel_announcement` message, and MUST set the `direction` bit of `flags` to 0 if the creating node is `node-id-1` in that message, otherwise 1.
Bits which are not assigned a meaning must be set to 0.

A node MAY create and send a `channel_update` with the `disable` bit set to signal the temporary unavailability of a channel, e.g., due to loss of connectivity, or the permanent unavailability, e.g., ahead of an on-chain settlement.
A subsequent `channel_update` with the `disable` bit unset MAY re-enable the channel.

The creating node MUST set `timestamp` to greater than zero, and MUST set it to greater than any previously-sent `channel_update` for this channel.

It MUST set `cltv-expiry-delta` to the number of blocks it will subtract from an incoming HTLCs `cltv-expiry`.  It MUST set `htlc-minimum-msat` to the minimum HTLC value it will accept, in millisatoshi.  It MUST set `fee-base-msat` to the base fee it will charge for any HTLC, in millisatoshi, and `fee-proportional-millionths` to the amount it will charge per millionth of a satoshi.

The receiving node MUST ignore `flags` other than the least significant bit.
The receiving node SHOULD ignore `ipv6`
if `port` is zero.  It SHOULD ignore the message if `short-channel-id` does
not correspond to a previously
known, unspent channel from `channel_announcement`, otherwise the node-id
is taken from the `channel_announcement` `node-id-1` if least-significant bit of flags is 0 or `node-id-2` otherwise.
The receiving node SHOULD fail the connection if `signature` is not a
valid signature using `node-id` of the double-SHA256 of the entire
message following the `signature` field (including unknown fields
following `fee-proportional-millionths`), and MUST NOT further process the message.

The receiving node SHOULD ignore the message if `timestamp`
is not greater than than the last-received `channel_announcement` for
this channel and node-id.  Otherwise, if the `timestamp` is equal to
the last-received `channel_announcement` and the fields other than
`signature` differ, the node MAY blacklist this node-id and forget all
channels associated with it.  Otherwise the receiving node SHOULD
queue the message for rebroadcasting, but MAY choose not to for
messages longer than the minimum expected length.

## Initial Sync

Upon establishing a connection, the two endpoints negotiate whether to perform an initial sync by setting the `initial_routing_sync` flags in the `init` message.
The endpoint SHOULD set the `initial_routing_sync` flag if it requires a full copy of the other endpoint's routing state.
Upon receiving an `init` message with the `initial_routing_sync` flag set the node sends `channel_announcement`s, `channel_update`s and `node_announcement`s for all known channels and nodes as if they were just received. 

If the `initial_routing_sync` flag is not set, or initial sync was completed, then the node resumes normal operation, see the _Rebroadcasting_ section for details.

## Rebroadcasting

Nodes receiving a new `channel_announcement` or a `channel_update` or
`node_update` with an updated timestamp update their local view of the network's topology accordingly.

Once the announcement has been processed it is added to a list of outgoing announcements (perhaps replacing older updates) to the processing node's peers, which will be flushed at regular intervals.
This store and delayed forward broadcast is called a _staggered broadcast_

If, after applying the changes from the announcement, there are no channels associated with the announcing node, then the receiving node MAY purge the announcing node from the set of known nodes.
Otherwise the receiving node updates the metadata and stores the signature associated with the announcement.
This will later allow the receiving node to rebuild the announcement for its peers.

After processing the announcement the receiving node adds the announcement to a list of outgoing announcements.

### Requirements

Each node SHOULD flush outgoing announcements once every 60 seconds, independently of the arrival times of announcements, resulting in a staggered announcement and deduplication of announcements.

Nodes MAY re-announce their channels regularly, however this is discouraged in order to keep the resource requirements low.

Nodes SHOULD send all `channel_announcement` messages followed by the
latest `node_announcement` and `channel_update` messages upon
connection establishment.

### Rationale

Batching announcements form a natural ratelimit with low overhead.

The sending of all announcements on reconnection is naive, but simple,
and allows bootstrap for new nodes as well as updating for nodes which
have been offline for some time.

## HTLC Fees

The node creating `channel_update` SHOULD accept HTLCs which pay a fee equal or greater than:

    fee-base-msat + htlc-amount-msat * fee-proportional-millionths / 1000000

The node creating `channel_update` SHOULD accept HTLCs which pay an
older fee for some time after sending `channel_update` to allow for
propagation delay.

## Recommendations for Routing

As the fee is proportional, it must be calculated backwards from the
destination to the source: only the amount required at the final
destination is known initially.

When calculating a route for an HTLC, the `cltv-expiry-delta` and the fee both
need to be considered: the `cltv-expiry-delta` contributes to the time that funds
will be unavailable on worst-case failure.  The tradeoff between these
two is unclear, as it depends on the reliability of nodes.

Other more advanced considerations involve diversity of routes to
avoid single points of failure and detection, and channel balance
of local channels.
