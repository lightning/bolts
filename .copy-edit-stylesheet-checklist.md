      - exception: `Introduction` section
  - capitalization
    - table of contents
    - headers
    - capitalize list items containing complete sentences
    - commonly forgotten: 'Lightning', 'ID'
    - distinguish between network and currency unit
      - e.g. "The Bitcoin network transfers bitcoins."

    - correct comma, colon, semi-colon, em-dash placement
    - for conjoined items, use comma before conjunction

      - exceptions, e.g. 'non-zero', '1 byte in length'
    - data measurements
      - type digits for quantities of information, use hyphen when unit is an adjective
        - e.g. 'a 32-bit block is 32 bits in length'
    - for typed calculations
      - space both sides of operators (except '^' and negative numbers)
        - e.g. 5 - 3^2 * 4 = -31
    - for calculation descriptions
      - write out operators
        - e.g. 1 less than 3 equals 2
