# Basic checklist/stylesheet used for copy editing BOLTs

Contributions should comply with this checklist/stylsheet to maintain correct, clear, consistent, and concise BOLTS. 

  - spelling
    - run `tools/spellcheck.sh --check [0-9][0-9]-*.md`
      - update `.aspell.en.pws` with any missing words

    - sentence fragments
    - run-on sentences
    - dangling, misplaced modifiers
    - consistent paragraph tense (e.g. past, present, future)
    - passive voice (e.g. avoid 'we')
      - use 'local/remote' terminology rather than 'us/them' or 'we/they'
      - exception: `Introduction` section
  - capitalization
    - table of contents
    - headers
    - capitalize list items containing complete sentences
    - commonly forgotten: 'Lightning', 'ID'
    - distinguish between network and currency unit
      - e.g. "The Bitcoin network transfers bitcoins."
  - punctuation
    - correct comma, colon, semi-colon, em-dash placement
    - for conjoined items, use comma before conjunction
      - e.g. 'this, that, and the other'
    - appropriate use of parenthesis
    - only use periods after list items if they contain complete sentences
      - exceptions: `Requirements` lists
  - abbreviations
    - e.g., i.e., etc., a.k.a.
  - formatting
    - single spaces between sentences
    - consistent use of _emphasis_, **strong**, `code`, CAPS, 'quotes'
    - single line separators between paragraphs and page elements
    - ensure correct header weights
  - numbers and calculations
    - spell out small (<10) amounts
    - type digits and enumerations
      - e.g. 'two 2-byte blocks set to 0s', 'one 4-byte block set to 1s', 'the other one is equal to 1'
      - exceptions, e.g. 'non-zero', '1 byte in length'
    - data measurements
      - type digits for quantities of information, use hyphen when unit is an adjective
        - e.g. 'a 32-bit block is 32 bits in length'
    - for typed calculations
      - space both sides of operators (except '^' and negative numbers)
        - e.g. 5 - 3^2 * 4 = -31
    - for calculation descriptions
      - write out operators
        - e.g. 1 less than 3 equals 2
  - list structure
    - 2 spaces before item
    - indent 2 spaces
    - `Requirements` sections
      - colon after conditions
