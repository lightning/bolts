# BOLT #11: Invoice Protocol for Lightning Payments

A simple, extensible QR-code-ready protocol for requesting payments
over Lightning.

# Table of Contents
  
# Encoding Overview

The format for a lightning invoice uses
[bech32 encoding](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0173.mediawiki),
which is already proposed for bitcoin Segregated Witness, and can be
simply reused here even though its 6-character checksum is optimized
for manual entry, which is unlikely to happen often given the length
of lightning invoices.

## Requirements

A writer MUST encode the the payment request in Bech32 as specified in
BIP-0173.  A reader MUST parse the address as Bech32 as specified in
BIP-0173, and MUST fail if the checksum is incorrect.

# Human Readable Part

The human readable part consists of two sections:
1. `prefix`: `ln` + BIP-0173 currency prefix (e.g. `lnbc`, `lntb`)
1. `amount`: optional number in that currency, followed by optional
   `multiplier`.

The following `multiplier` letters are defined:

* `m` (milli): multiply by 0.001
* `u` (micro): multiply by 0.000001
* `n` (nano): multiply by 0.000000001
* `p` (pico): multiply by 0.000000000001

## Requirements

A writer MUST include `amount` if payments will be refused if less
than that.  A writer MUST encode `amount` as a positive decimal
integer with no leading zeroes, SHOULD use the shortest representation
possible.

A reader MUST fail if it does not understand the `prefix`.  A reader
SHOULD fail if `amount` contains a non-digit, or is followed by
anything except a `multiplier` in the table above.

A reader SHOULD indicate if amount is unspecified, otherwise it MUST
multiply `amount` by the `multiplier` value (if any) to derive the
amount required for payment.

## Rationale

The `amount` is encoded into the human readable part, as it's fairly
readable and a useful indicator of how much is being requested.

Donation addresses often don't have an associated amount, so `amount`
is optional in that case: usually a minimum payment is required for
whatever is being offered in return.

# Data Part

The data part consists of multiple sections:

1. `timestamp`: seconds-since-1970 (35 bits, big-endian)
1. Zero or more tagged parts.
1. `signature`: bitcoin-style signature of above. (520 bits)

## Requirements

A writer MUST set `timestamp` to the time to
the number of seconds since Midnight 1 January 1970, UTC in
big-endian.  A writer MUST set `signature` to a valid
512-bit secp256k1 signature of the double SHA2 256-bit hash of the
Human Readable Part concatenated with the Data Part and zero bits
appended to the next byte boundary, with a trailing byte containing
the recovery ID (0, 1, 2 or 3).

A reader MUST check that the `signature` is valid (see the `n` tagged
field specified below).

## Rationale

`signature` covers an exact number of bytes because although the SHA-2
standard actually supports hashing in bit boundaries, it's not widely
implemented.  The recovery ID allows public key recovery, so the
identity of the payee node can be implied.

## Tagged Fields

Each Tagged Field is of format:

1. `type` (5 bits)
1. `data_length` (10 bits, big-endian)
1. `data` (`data_length` x 5 bits)

Currently defined Tagged Fields are:

* `p` (1): `data_length` 52.  256-bit SHA256 payment_hash: preimage of this provides proof of payment.
* `d` (13): `data_length` variable.  short description of purpose of payment (ASCII),  e.g. '1 cup of coffee'
* `n` (19): `data_length` 53.  The 33-byte public key of the payee node.
* `h` (23): `data_length` 52.  256-bit description of purpose of payment (SHA256).  This is used to commit to an associated description which is too long to fit, such as may be contained in a web page.
* `x` (6): `data_length` variable.  `expiry` time in seconds (big-endian). Default is 3600 (1 hour) if not specified.
* `f` (9): `data_length` variable, depending in version. Fallback on-chain address: for bitcoin, this starts with a 5 bit `version`; a witness program or P2PKH or P2SH address.
* `r` (3): extra routing information.  This should be appended to the route
      to allow routing to non-public nodes; there may be more than one of these.
   * `pubkey` (264 bits)
   * `channel_id` (64 bits)
   * `fee` (64 bits, big-endian)
   * `cltv_expiry_delta` (16 bits, big-endian)

### Requirements

A writer MUST include exactly one `p` field, and set `payment_hash` to
the SHA-2 256-bit hash of the `payment_preimage` which will be given
in return for payment.

A writer MUST NOT include more than one `d`, `h`, or `x` fields, and
MAY include more than one `f` field.

A writer MUST include either a `d` or `h` field, and MUST NOT include
both.  If included, a writer SHOULD make `d` a complete description of
the purpose of the payment.  If included, a writer MUST make the preimage
of the hashed description in `h` available through some unspecified means,
which SHOULD be a complete description of the purpose of the payment.

A writer SHOULD use the minimum `x` `data_length` possible.

A writer MAY include an `n` field, which MUST be set to the public key
used to create the `signature`.

If a writer offers more than one of any field type, it MUST specify
the most-preferred field first, followed by less-preferred fields in
order.

For bitcoin payments, a writer MUST set an
`f` field to a valid witness version and program, or `17` followed by
a public key hash, or `18` followed by a script hash.

A writer MUST include at least one `r` field if it does not have a
public channel associated with its public key.  The `pubkey` is the
node ID of the start of the channel, `channel_id` is the channel ID
field to identify the channel, `fee` is the total fee required to use
that channel to send `amount` to the final node, specified in 10^-11
currency units, and `cltv_expiry_delta` is the block delta required
by the channel.  A writer MAY include more than one `r` field to
indicate a sequence of non-public channels to traverse.

A writer MUST pad field data to a multiple of 5 bits, using zeroes.

A reader MUST skip over unknown fields, an `f` field with unknown
`version`, or a `p`, `h`, `n` or `r` field which does not have ``data_length`` 52,
52, 53 or 79 respectively.

A reader MUST check that the SHA-2 256 in the `h` field exactly
matches the hashed description.

A reader MUST use the `n` field to validate the signature instead of
performing signature recovery if a valid `n` field is provided.

### Rationale

The type-and-length format allows future extensions to be backward
compatible.  `data_length` is always a multiple of 5 bits, for easy
encoding and decoding.  For fields we expect may change, readers
also ignore ones of different length.

The `p` field supports the current 256-bit payment hash, but future
specs could add a new variant of different length, in which case
writers could support both old and new, and old readers would ignore
the one not the correct length.

The `d` field allows inline descriptions, but may be insufficient for
complex orders; thus the `h` field allows a summary, though the method
by which the description is served is as-yet unspecified, and will
probably be transport-dependent.  The `h` format could change in future
by changing the length, so readers ignore it if not 256 bits.

The `n` field can be used to explicitly specify the destination node ID,
instead of requiring signature recovery.

The `x` field gives advance warning as to when a payment will be
refused; this is mainly to avoid confusion.  The default was chosen
to be reasonable for most payments, and allow sufficient time for
on-chain payment if necessary.

The `f` field allows on-chain fallback.  This may not make sense for
tiny or very time-sensitive payments, however.  It's possible that new
address forms will appear, and so multiple `f` fields in an implied
preferred order help with transition, and `f` fields with versions 19-31
will be ignored by readers.

The `r` field allows limited routing assistance: as specified it only
allows minimum information to use private channels, but it could also
assist in future partial-knowledge routing.  Future formats are
possible by altering the length, too.

# Payer / Payee Interactions

These are generally defined by the rest of the lightning BOLT series,
but it's worth noting that BOLT #5 specifies that the payee SHOULD
accept up to twice the expected `amount`, so the payer can make
payments harder to track by adding small variations.

The intent is that the payer recover the payee's node ID from the
signature, and after checking the conditions are acceptable (fees,
expiry, block timeout), attempt a payment.  It can use `r` fields to
augment its routing information if necessary to reach the final node.

If the payment succeeds but there is a later dispute, the payer can
prove both the signed offer from the payee, and the successful
payment.

## Payer / Payee Requirements

A payer SHOULD NOT attempt a payment after the `timestamp` plus
`expiry` has passed.  Otherwise, if a lightning payment fails, a payer
MAY attempt to use the address given the first `f` field it
understands for payment.  A payer MAY use the sequence of channels
specified by `r` to route to the payee.  A payer SHOULD consider the
fee amount and payment timeout before initiating payment.  A payer
SHOULD use the first `p` field did not skip as the payment hash.

A payee SHOULD NOT accept a payment after `timestamp` plus `expiry`.
